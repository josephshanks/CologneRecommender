       "{'kirrineyears': \"A simple and lovely classic. I don't wear many masculines, but this is very classy and easy to enjoy. An initial blast of sweet lavender quickly gives way to a vanilla musk dry down - just as the notes list suggests. A clean scent that suits a post day-time shower and reminds of fresh white bath towels and cool spring/summer breeze from surrounding lavender fields in the French countryside. I think guys of 30+ can wear this well. May 24 2020\",\n",
       " 'Registeralloveragain': 'I’ve got a vintage bottle and a current, the current is actually better. It is a very simple scent though, surprisingly the Sport version is actually way more complex and better. The sport version has a natural ambergris note which is awesome. It isn’t any kind of ambrox or any of those, it definitely is like a small amount of natural ambergris. My reference for ambergris is baikal Gris from areej le dore May 14 2020',\n",
       " 'Littlevic': 'Love this!  Been looking for a realistic lavender perfume for years, tried all the female fragrances but they weren’t quite right, So after reading reviews on this one, thought I’d give it a go, starts off with a proper blast of fresh masculine truest realistic herbalist lavender,  very much like Caldey Island lavender ( not in the data base) then dries down to a vanilla musk with hints of lavender peeping back through, I do get the play doh vibe but I like it, reminds me of a more reserved hypnotic poison May 11 2020',\n",
       " 'Luna_J': \"I picked up a small sample of this at the improbably old-world, third-floor Caron boutique in New York [edit: since moved on]... In my memory, the smell of lavender is now layered over all of that urbanity, but surviving impressions are: yes, the play dough accord at the start, but (also yes) that association vanishes quickly. This scent very rapidly insinuates itself into your sensibility, more so than almost anything I've tried, it becomes a second skin of (what best sums this up?) bonhomie, confidence, 'oldworldmasculinity', comfort, with a little of (great phrase from Gatsby), 'romantic readiness'. You feel taken care of, if that makes sense. The combination of apparent simplicity with (also apparent, certainly to you) excellent construction seems like a piece of really lovely, expensive and well crafted but unpretentious tailoring made in a fabric that wears better as it ages (I have a charcoal grey flannel suit that is like this). Somehow after six days it had gone from reading as 'play dough' to a sort of sheer yet earthy, rosemary-infused oleos amber musk, like the lining of a suede jacket just as it drapes over your shoulders. The mix of cool and warm, earthy and sophisticated, and easy and refined is terribly simple, direct and nonetheless addictive and a little mysterious. Despite being very obviously about lavender, this is (really) not like any lavender you know. Apr 04 2015\",\n",
       " 'adiscourseinfragrance': 'Beautiful fragrance, I really hope this house continues to last in the future despite recent troubles. Has to be the best representation of lavender I have smelt, mellowed by lovely vanilla and musk. As other reviewers have said a bit soft and powdery at the end and I would agree. The modern one (at least) does not to seem to be a beast but then I do not think it needs to be, I’m not sure it was ever meant to be, you can appreciate it for the classy fragrance it is. An historical gem thoroughly deserving of contemporary appreciation ! Apr 28 2020',\n",
       " 'Fjb2210': 'My new routine working from home....Wake up,shower, get dressed, sit at my home computer with a hot cup of coffee with sweet cream.. turn on Duke Ellington...and spray 4-5 hits of Pour Un Homme De Caron... and get to work...Its an incredible fragrance.. Longevity is very good but its easy to get nose blind to it. I usually reapply every few hours to get that feeling of classic fresh and creaminess that comes with it. Perfect smell for sitting and relaxing or heading out on a spring day. Extremely versatile. Apr 20 2020',\n",
       " 'FatLipWill': '[Pour Un Homme de Caron]I’m starting to come to terms with the fact that Lavender just makes me nauseous and almost to the point of gagging. Caron Pour Un Homme being the biggest offender to date. I’ve owned a few lavender dominant fragrances from Eau de L’Occitane to Jicky and whilst liking a few, I’ve never considered them to be mind-blowing. I like lavender in a supporting role rather than the headliner in most cases. Pour Un Homme is to me a very dated fragrance. Now I’m not saying people cannot pull it off, but for my nose it screams early 20th century in the worst kind of way. It is also setting off some kind of forgotten olfactory memory but I cannot place it but it is worth mentioning. The fragrance begins very herbal and jarring however tones down within 5-10 minutes to create a very smooth and incredibly well blended scent. I cannot stress how well crafted this fragrance is even before considering it has been around since 1934. I highly respect the craftsmanship here.When compared to fragrances the likes of Shalimar, Bal À Versailles and even Aramis, Pour Un Homme is very much a victim of its time. The previous fragrances mentioned have aged incredibly gracefully and feel relatively contemporary even in today’s market. Like the ambroxen bombs of today in a generations time, Caron is let down by its complete faithfulness to ingredients and tropes of its day. While not for me, I understand that this fragrance is incredibly well made and a classic perfume. This fragrance has a very apparent cult following and I’m pleased to see that many love Pour Un Homme and keep Caron in the minds of many, so this legend isn’t left behind to time. I encourage people to at least seek out a sample even if only to add to your mental database. Apr 18 2020',\n",
       " 'Krisena': \"I understand what they mean by old school. It has that powdery denseness to it. I like it, but I'm not sure it's for me. It starts as vanilla with a wood-like dryness to it that I think comes from a note of rosemary, but the rosemary disappears and the lavender enters more and more as time goes on. The vanilla is softened as well. I would maybe have preferred something a little more complex, but it was interesting to try. Sillage is moderate. Apr 01 2020\",\n",
       " 'M-as-Marin': 'For many of those who are trying to pretend as perfume connoisseurs, yet can\\'t get the musk note I recommend the following:1. Use Caron PH in the warmer weather.2. Reviewing after just few wearing is useless, therefore stop doing that3. Once you really get to know this fragrance after 30-40 mls, that slightly \"pissy\" note will come up. Once you get it, you will know that it is the musk you are smellingYou are welcome!P.S. This fragrance was or still is a signature scent of Thiery Wasser and Tom Ford. I think that this speaks a lot of this fragrance. Mar 18 2020',\n",
       " 'Naughtius Maximus': 'This is the same vein as Shalimar Eau de Toilette. The only difference being that Shalimar is more powdery and sweet, while Pour Un Homme is powdery, but not overly sweet because there\\'s presence of rose, rosemary and lavender for the most part. Subtle, yet huge difference.Spray it on your hand and after about an hour exhale (hooh?) warm air onto the place you\\'ve sprayed and smell it. You will understand what I\\'m saying. The dominant rosemary and subtle rose will instantly kick in your nose. Old school shaving creme vibes.The musk isn\\'t animalic or off-putting. Very sophisticated, however in my experience it\\'s mostly for daytime/morning use. This doesn\\'t have the night time character for me because I strongly resemble my  success with the early, morning hours. When most are sleeping and you prepare yourself for work.I believe this is for more mature gentlemen (30+) who are shaving or trimming daily as I believe you have to be in that mood in order to truly reflect the way this fragrance was supposed to be worn. With old school manners, by old school appreciators. Unisex vibes? Not sure about that. To my nose it has a quite masculine herbal backbone. I don\\'t discourage other to try it, however - be aware.EDIT: Turns out this was featured in the movie \"American Psycho\" when Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) showed his morning routine, alongside YSL Pour Homme and Pour Lui. Mar 10 2020',\n",
       " 'OldFragMan': 'Rarely am I wowed by a fragrance but this is one of those that has that affect on me. In all it’s simplicity it is truly a masterpiece with the perfect blend of lavender and vanilla (as the dominant notes). This to me is an any time anywhere, all season easy reach. It’s classy and mature and I’m sure it has a dated vibe to some. I’m ok with that because less people will be wearing it. 9.5 out of 10 in all respects. Wow! Feb 28 2020',\n",
       " 'marcel2782': 'Pure vanilla (non sweet, in the Musc Ravageur style, to cite an example known to most), delicately lavended (no excess, something rare, as many perfumes that use lavender exaggerate the dose), under a strong and wild musky background, almost excessive. As for the green liquid, it is misleading for there is NO green tone present in the aroma. I expected something barbershop-like, but Pour un Homme has nothing from barbershop, as there is no alcohol content or other typical macho-man notes. The end result of the heart refers to a simplified version of Musc Ravageur. Satisfactory power. Feb 09 2020',\n",
       " 'Tomasr': 'My girlfriend had recently bought this for my 30th birthday, knowing that I particularly enjoy fragrances with the note of lavender. It was a \"risky blind buy\" but I waited with anticipation as I already had this fragrance on my want list. Given the mixed reviews, the positive reviews had put me at ease that I\\'d enjoy this fragrance.When it finally arrived, and was able to give it my first whiff, my initial response was \"wow this is amazing\" .. In the opening, I immediately detected the lavender, basically aromatherapy lavender, with a citrusy touch of bergamont or lemon alongside a subtle licorice type, and soft play-dough accord. I think I also detect sage and some woods, but it\\'s also perhaps the bitter lavender giving it a \"wet woodsy\" aroma. This fragrance is so beautifully crafted..the transition into the vanilla is smooth as you can begin to pick up a soft & subtle vanilla..elegant in simplistic fashion. It reminds me of a soap product from L\\'Occitane. After telling my mom what I had received for my birthday, she told me that my late grandfather used to wear this. I\\'m not surprised by this, because he was a man of taste. This is a fragrance that withstood the test of time for 86 years and is still going strong. It doesn\\'t smell dated, but rather natural..as long as you truly enjoy the notes of lavender and vanilla, you\\'ll most certainly enjoy this one. I\\'m still struggling to pick up the musk as it seems absent at least to my nose. That said, I find it contemporary, and very wearable. You\\'ll stand out in a nice way, and if people ask what you\\'re wearing, you can tell them it\\'s a fragrance from the 1930\\'s ;) ... This was also a signature scent of Tom Ford.This is the perfect fragrance to enter my 30s with..easily a 10/10. Feb 05 2020',\n",
       " 'Adair': \"I wanted to love this because of its history as the first true scent designed for men (1930's). Alas...the opening notes for me evoke urine or rash. My wife hated it, said it did not smell masculine. Once it dried down, it became tolerable, more lavender. I can't imagine a contemporary man wearing this--it smells quite dated, from an era with a different interpretation of masculinity. I shall decant into a sprayer and use it to perfume bed sheets and pillow covers--it is perfect for that. Feb 05 2020\",\n",
       " 'brokesta911': 'A balanced Lavender & Vanilla accord.Starts with a blast of fresh & herbal Lavender, though thankfully does NOT smell like Lavender essential oil. After a couple of minutes, it settles down into this PlayDoh accord (that I honestly find that endearing), but dries down into a Vanilla that isn’t sugary sweet, but refined and incense-like with a touch a Lavender.  A classic & understated fragrance. I believe this is what today’s men and women should wear. For people that understand who they are and are not swayed by pop culture or other people’s opinions or compliments. Jan 17 2020',\n",
       " 'yafresh': 'nothing contemperary about this one.. old school to the max   men 50 and over may enjoy this scent..   i get  a candle vanella cake smell . Jan 01 2020',\n",
       " 'Le Chypriote': \"Let's see what this French classic revealed to my nose...This legend opens up with a sharp and soapy herbal freshness. There's lemongrass too, and citrus fruit.In the heart you have Lily-of-the-valley, and a faint, struggling lavender.The dry-down is where this star shines; vanilla and amber stand together on a backdrop of musk to finish this masterpiece off.A uniquely refined classic that remains relevant in a world of constant change. Dec 12 2019\",\n",
       " 'Don Joe': 'Unlike many others, I do enjoy the strong medicinal opening, which is one of the reasons why I prefer to apply this to my clothes.If I put it on my skin, the lavender is completely gone within 3 minutes, followed by some 10-15 minutes of vanilla, and then I smell like my 95 year old great-great-aunt. Am I the only one to whom the musk in this fragrance smells like old people? Not really \"animalic\" or \"fecal\", just the smell of really old people.However, when I put this on my clothes, the lavender lasts longer and the transition between lavender and vanilla is smoother. So somewhere between the strong medicinal lavender, and the mild sweet vanilla, there are about 2-3 minutes of that truly amazing lavender-vanilla accord. And that\\'s it. After that, there\\'s only vanilla, and it stays on clothes for many days, albeit only as a \"skin\" scent (or rather cloth scent). And unless I spray many times on the same spot, I cannot smell any musk on my clothes.I\\'m kinda beginning to get this perfume. It doesn\\'t spoil you by giving you all the goodness at once and lasting for hours. It makes you wait for the right moment and appreciate it while it lasts, and then it\\'s just teasing of the vanilla sweetness left behind.One more thing about this prefume. There is absolutely nothing bad about it, nothing which I wouldn\\'t like (as long as I don\\'t put it on my skin). So many perfumes, as great as they may be, often give me headaches, or they literally hurt my nose, or they dry my throat or sting in my eyes... or I simply get tired of them after wearing them for a couple of hours. Or there\\'s just some ingredient, some chemical, some note which I don\\'t like. It may still be a very good perfume, but almost always there\\'s something which I don\\'t like about it, no matter how natural or expensive or niche the perfume is. Not with this one. It\\'s an extremely okay™ perfume, and I mean that in a good way. Nov 27 2019',\n",

       " '6opar': 'Lavender and vanilla are one of Earth’s best couples and, like coffee and milk, Simon and Garfunkel, summer and sea, Lanvin sneakers, banitza and boza, are great on their own, but when paired they go cosmic levels. Pour un Homme de Caron is one of Earth’s best examples of how amazing this couple smells.

The lavender is almost grassy - it smells very 'green' and fresh. It jostles with the vanilla in a similar way to how Kokorico's cocao jostles with the fig leaf.Very natural - a subtle statement, refined. Smells classic but vibrant. Smart person's fragrance.

I might be laying upon the scent with my memory of horrid scents but being honest, it does!Thank the stars that doesnt last long at all, perhaps a few seconds!For a short while, it remains with me as a good old fashioned mans scent, true lavender vibes, and as other posters have said, reminiscent of the roaring 20s. Sadly, that fades, kinda like the memories of the 20s (im not that old!)It ends up being a completely different beast. Almost Jekyl and Hyde this scent. It begins to take on that vanilla musk tone, and the lavender is totally and utterly gone.Wether thats a bad thing, i dont know, as the base tone on this is so much different, perhaps lavender notes mixed in would just muddy it.The end result is not BAD, just not expected. It falls into a similar grouping of scents that are abundant in my fridge, and doesnt....well....stand out. It fades into the rest, like that lavender faded away.Its sad, as i really wanted this to be different, and although it is to start with, it becomes the grey man, dissapearing into the sea of other scents.

But I think it's a cynical comparison. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, of course; but why choose to see the negative? I've never understood that when it comes to fragrance analysis. If there's any fault I could find with this fragrance, it's that its longevity isn't great. It's made with minimal ingredients, and they're pretty volatile. Reapplication is key for rocking this fragrance with any degree of noticablility. And at that rate, you'd be going through your bottle pretty quickly because this really is an eau de cologne. However, it has got to be one of the finest Lavender fragrances ever made. The vanilla gives it almost a woody quality. May 29 2019\",\n",

It's actually quite pleasant and interesting too - I can see the similarities in character to other scents from the era, like old spice and some women's scents.  It's quite thick and fluffy is what I mean.Anwyays, it smells real nice, lavender and an marshmallow like scent.

       " 'ericrico': 'Something from another era - and it smells like it. This is, as another reviewer put it, more of a scent than a fragrance. Sharp lavender, musk and vanilla are the three components everyone focuses on, but there are a few more overtones (and undertones) in Caron Pour Un Homme. \"Minimalism is beauty in its simplest form\"...this holds true with this bottle of magical aromas.I find current formulation to be very refreshing if applied liberally or reapplied within 10-15 minutes of 1st application (layering increases the scent\\'s projection and longevity). The key is to spray very close to the skin (about 1\") to \\'stack the scent\\'. In current formulation, this allows the lavender to show its beauty and articulate its duality in the scent (leaf and floral). The effect is interesting - the vanilla is more potent in current formulation and the close application provides better longevity and true form of scent. Otherwise, I find that the notes separate and the richness of the composition is not nearly as well-presented. The vanilla dominates in current juice. Vintage formulation has more musk and sharp lavender (and overall less vanilla, although it is still an amazing drydown to a vanilla/musk & warm amber on the skin).My preferred method of applying this lush, comforting scent is to pour a generous amount into my cupped palm from my 750ml giant flacon and splash it on my neck, chest and arms.  The \"playdoh\" effect is minimalized and the lavender presents itself more.  Plus, it is a celebration of the classique methode of application for this timeless piece of olfactive art.Each and every wearing, I am immediately reminded that this is classic perfumery...undeniably and indisputably (regardless of formulation). It is the showcase of a gorgeous lavender soliflore, as it has both the sharp, herbal aspect of lavender leaf along with the soft and fragrant floral accord of the same stem. The vanilla picks up the floral quality of the lavender, which is soothing and has light sweetness...while the musk carries the herbal feeling of the lavender, creating balance and brilliant harmony in this divine composition and not allowing this great scent to be cloying.The longevity is not great but definitely adequate and above average (as it dries down and stays on your skin). You get a very nice fresh lavender aroma that intermingles with the warm vanilla/musk base for about 3-4 hours on my skin with decent projection. After that, it dries down a nice, radiant skin scent and lasts for another 4+ hours. A true classic...a gentleman\\'s scent from 1934 on the shelf today in my wardrobe. Caron, as a house, is simply top-shelf. A very non-mainstream line of fragrances (many unisex) that transcend time and olfactory notes that are atypically together or compositions that are tastefully unique. I will not get into all the other Caron fragrances I know, have and love.This is about a timeless scent - Caron Pour Un Homme. One should have this in their fragrance collection. It will be around, most likely, forever...and generations should pass this on. My rating is not in points - but in a thankful and gracious nod to Caron for keeping this great bottle around all these years. Merci! Apr 13 2019',\n",

The texture of this fragrance is like a grey double-breasted flannel suit rather than one made of 98% wool/2% spandex.  It’s a bit fuzzy, soft, powdery, yes, but give it time. As you grow accustomed to the manner of composition, one can begin to appreciate the appeal.  Fragrances, much like music, transport us to earlier eras, where societal sentiments were decidedly different.

Now, it is still a soliflore, so normally to appreciate it you need at least to like lavender.

Modern Jicky parfum sadly lacks both the complexity and the longevity of the original so I\\'m always searching for a good approximation of that. Most lavenders I can\\'t stand because when the lavender is buried in other things most of what comes through is the turpenic (I think that\\'s the right term.) and powdery aspects, the \"barbershop\" affect.Caron pour un Homme gets the lavender right. It\\'s fresh and light with an emphasis on the carmelized aspects, just gorgeous.Then I went in for a sniff before I went back and sprayed some more - uh oh!I have a complicated relationship with vanilla too. (What can I say, I\\'m a complicated woman.) I love a dark, boozy, unsweetened vanilla. Modern aromachemical vanillas that smell like cupcakes have me running for the hills. That first sniff was enough to set of my cupcake alarms.Over time though, pour un Homme and I settled in nicely. I wound up spraying on some more and the vanilla and lavender balanced each other harmoniously. Eventually, the lavender gave way to the middle which was a fairly sweet vanilla but not cupcake-y. Overall, I found it comforting and well done. My son said I smelled good, an unheard of concession.The longevity and projection were moderate and I enjoyed it the whole time.

Delicate compared to most modern, off the shelf stuff; but done so well it's no wonder it still sells since 1934.The Lavender opening is soft and quickly enveloped by a creamy non-sweet vanilla note that cordially settles onto an equally good and not-too-sweet musk cloud that recycles the entire three note ensemble noticeably for a good hour or more and then you will get a hint of it yourself only; but others are well aware of it should they get close enough. They will inevitably move closer to you to get more of what you're carrying.Overspray is unlikely and I've already had bizarre daydream fantasies of filling an entire tub with the huge bottles available and dipping into it everything I own in sequence until my entire life is infused with this scent.

I can feel comfortable as a man wearing this classy masculine lavender. I love woody, earthy smelling frags. This lavender is very earthy and natural smelling, the flower with the leaves and twigs mixed in. The vanela and musc ad a refined touch. I love the simplicity.

Pour Homme has a similar feel, but lighter, and can be used in Spring and Summer.I've been reading reviews here that mention notes not listed, like Tonka, coumarin, etc. I think they know what they're talking about because I also thought I was getting a bit of woods and something fresh and almost citrusy, like lemon grass perhaps. I liked the image that someone mentioned of an older gentleman on a metro in France, you may often come across wearing Caron Pour Homme. A great simple, fresh classic.Note: Yes, on basenotes they list 12 notes. I do notice the Tonka, lemon, and a great note, Clary sage. The Clary sage is quite prominent I see now, at first I thought it was an aspect of the lavender I was smelling.This is my signature scent for now, for it's beautifull aromatic, floral simplicity and versatility.

Spray, and then you are free to go about your day. The only con is that it does not last on me in the colder climate here back home, or it just stays very discrete. Aug 25 2017',\n",
       " 'Yup$ki': \"I recently tried the Caron house and was pleasantly surprised. First ones I tried were Yatagan and Anachist...THIS and finally Le 3 Homme. After sampling these I like them all but primarily the first 3 mentioned. The aromas of these made me 'think' , upon hitting the senses. They smell authentic and classic, taking you back to a certain time/setting perhaps. To my nose, this doesn't smell like playdoh but I see the comparison. It actually reminds Me ,of two things. One is, that stick of gum that came in the wax packs of those Garbage Pail Kids or sports cards. I was all over those like flies on dogshit back in the early to mid eighties..so, that's the 'time era' it make me feel. The other would be Pinaud scented barber talc. So not bad at all! It will always be in my collection. I feel that you gotta have a certain appreciation for classic scents, to fully appreciate this. I actually held off on this one, thinking it might smell  a bit TOO dated..leaving one no choice but to smell like everyones grandpa, hah! But as others mention it's been around for this long for a reason. Very versatile juice. Lasts on my skin, 6 hours or so. On my shirts, a few days. I rock it casual from time to time for nostalgia or before bed. Enjoy!!UpdateWow this stuff is good!!!  Doesn't get stale at all..stays pretty linear.  Knowing this stuff was introduced in 1934, it blows my mind how it's still so readily available at the affordable price ot bears.  However i don't understand how the intense goes for such a high price..SMH!  When wearing this it always feels like stepping into a time machine, assuming there wasn't as much (for men) to select from back then.  So this is simply what 'a man' would wear..or one of say 5-10 contemporary colognes back then, as only the rich and well to do wore colognes back then.  But whatever the era or living class, if this was the only one i owned it would have been a pleasure.  If i could match this with an image/movie scene , it would be Ricky Ricardo coming home to Lucy or Marlon Brando in Streetcar Named Desire. Aug 21 2017\",\n",

I'm so glad I did. It's the truest lavender hit straight off the bat and I get something minty or very herbal I can't quite identify. The whole initial blasts feel like I've smelt it before but I think that's because it's just such a true lavender. And the dry down is utterly sublime. I adore it. Can't stop sniffing my arm. Soft, ethereal,  'your skin but better' scent. On the first day I'm almost prepared to say it's going to surpass my love for  eau sauvage and shalimar. And I can't believe I'm typing this. Ok I'll give it time, but it seems to have everything I want. I just got a big 100ml and I'm already thinking about stocking up. Utter madness!  It's completely captivating. Jul 17 2017\",\n",

The opening is an explosion of super sweet lavendar vanilla, like you've jumped from several stories up into a massive floral marshmallow. It is a bit old fashioned as it was first made before the advent of the jet engine, but IMO its simplicity is its strength. Make no mistake, if you don't like lavender you should definitely no make this a blind-buy, try it out first or smell it on someone you know.This is lavender and vanilla in big handfuls, and its as sweet as that implies. It's even more of a gourmand than I'd expected, with the lavender toning down a bit by the drydown to fall more in balance with the vanilla and musk (and wind up more powdery than sweet) - but that opening is certainly one of the sweetest experiences in my collection. I really like this, but warm weather is probably not the best time, so I will be putting this into the fall-winter box.Yatagan is next - here's hoping Caron can go 4-for-4. Jul 14 2017\",\n",

Now I have come to the point of getting a 200ml flacon and kicking a... with it!!!- An ever chic, timeless classic; Yet great for modern era as well.- Pampering, calming and tranquilizing.- Delicious and sweet as cookie.  Really feels edible.- By no means appears offensive or huge at all, even if overworn.  I whiffed once over 30 puffs at once and yet felt flying through a cloud of joy!!Just a very exceptional character, not like most others.  Never cloying and giving you headache or nose pain.  On the contrary, with any single sniff, it brings joy, relaxation and elegance.Starting up with a very calming strong lavender burst in quite natural and superb quality manner.  Though it\\'s totally understandable for those whom would complain the aquatic overdone part here, not matching the warm sweet notes of vanilla, amber and musk.  But no worries: very soon it\\'ll descend from the tip of the pyramid to get harmonized with other elements of the frag, as drying down.Soon, the soft dry powdery sweet blasts of vanilla would hit up with amber and musk.  The musk is a bit too intense, I can tell, but yet not cloying at all.And finally the soft light sweetness of vanilla mixed with musk remains plus escorted by a touch of cinnamon and I guess rose is also flying over.  The journey goes almost linear.  This frag is all the way so clean and executive as royal.The sweetness almost totally fades away within 12 hours, while the stubborn powdery notes still remain, but so soft and close.The longevity on my skin appeared moderate, but the projection is weak and that\\'s why I mentioned \"EXCEPTIONAL\" scent.  For such a scent, to me, it\\'s the beauty of being present but in the background, like it\\'s always faithful to you but never bothering shuffling around you.  It serves you like Siri or Google assistant!I would ideally use it firstly for spring time, then fall, winter and finally summer.  It\\'s versatile enough to be worn on heat, but maybe too sweet for those huge heat wave days.The bottle built quality and finishing all are a proof of a high quality French masterpiece, yet shining as the eye apple of Caron.All in all, I would give it the grades like this:- Scent:  9/10 (considering it was made in 1934, when the chemical tech. was in such a point)- Longevity:  6/10 (yet a good thing, knowing it\\'s a pre-WW2 formula!! and is 85% Vol., which appears sensibly more diluted than nowadays products)- Projection:  3/10- Price is amazingly attractive, so you may liberally and lavishly use it!  One bottle after another... :-)TOTAL SCORE: 9.5 of 10!  Yes, it\\'s simply a winner in a very high order! Jul 09 2017',\n",

I was hoping that this opening would have calmed down to something...more pleasant to my nose?  Unfortunately, after 2 hours it still remains quite linear...we'll see where it takes me later in the day. I'm also unsure of exactly when and where to sport this fragrance...it doesn't seem to fit my lifestyle (?)

It smells great and it's very unassuming at the same time. It's nice to have fragrances you can wear that you know smell good, but that don't give others the impression that you're trying to get attention.The quality of the lavender is natural, soft, powdery and a little earthy.

It does seem to be skillfully blended and is quite natural smelling.  Some reviews are reporting it's sweet, I feel the vanilla has just the right amount of slight sweetness.

       " 'MIWBUTT': \"Before you ever smell this classic that will reveal a great many notes in other fragrances you have smelled, there is first and foremost one thing you should know: Pour un Homme de Caron is a very deceptive fragrance. The first many tries you will have with PuHdC if you are like me and afraid to spray that much more than a spray on each arm due to the crazy strength, then this fragrance will exclusively be that vanilla lavender play-dough bomb your parents warned you about. But, if you don't give up on this doll just yet, there are two other things that will occur that will reveal a lot about this fragrance to you. The first of these two things is that you will try other fragrances that have this combo going on in the background (think Kilian's Taste of Heaven or Lalique's Pour Homme) and this will begin to show the vanilla, musk and lavender in different forms than you could differentiate previously, and this will start to make PuHdC understandable and beautiful. The second thing that will happen is you will spray more than one spray and start to see that indolic quality that lavender can have, and eventually you might even meet that vanilla all by itself.The lavender is a strong and brilliant lavender that benefits from its dual processes of extraction which give the lavender a 3d-feel to it - one that lacks any sweetness of its own. If sprayed more than once, you will experience this herbal lavender for some time before getting the full 'dough' effect of it mingling with the vanilla. Once this fades, the vanilla will stand on its own, as a skin-scented, mildly sweet vanilla that doesn't suffer from the synthetic mass-produced vanilla note that we are all most likely tired from at this point. Overall, I appreciate this combo as an addition to other fragrances. It seems like a chord progression, which, while pleasant, needs more going to make the song worth listening to in full. Nevertheless, it is a brilliant composition all the while which helps the nose in a great deal when it comes to fragrances that orient themselves towards this iconic quality.8/10YT: Jess AndWesH Oct 01 2016\",\n",
       " 'smellavision': \"Vanilla and lavender bomb! Very straightforward and rounded. Not especially masculine, but rather unisex in my opinion. Opening with pure lavender, which is - finally - caught up by the vanilla after one-two hours depending on weather and skin conditions.I like lavender, tonka and sage but I miss a little more freshness here. Ofcourse, being released in 1934 it will smell differently than most releases today - funny thing is that a lot of sweeter male fragrances have been released for the last ten years - repeating the cycle maybe ??Although there are 30 years in between, I can also see some similarities between this and Guerlain's Habit Rouge, with the later being much heavier on the lemon and rose (which is also present in this but not listed). Definitely a hit if you're a lavender lover. Personally, when mixed with vanilla, in this genre I prefer the lavender being replaced with something fresher like the cypress in Eau de Baux.

I love this part particularly... simply fantastic! But it comes at a price..... the initial atom bomb of lavender takes too long to die down.... you have to suffer a good hour or two before it gets full into the magical part of lavender/vanilla heaven.

I know it's probably my skin chemistry turning this to powder, which is unfortunate because I really like the way it smells in the vial.

Caron Pour Un Homme could only disappoint form there - but after one spray, it became obvious this scent could never disappoint.The opening is an intensely heavy, woody lavender. It's almost too much, but fortunately the lavender mellows quickly as the vanilla also comes to the fore. Both notes mingle together gloriously, with neither dominating as the scent dries down. The notes also grow sweeter as the scent settles on the skin. Musk is also present, but it plays a stealthy role, bolstering and rounding out the dominant notes like an unseen stagehand - its artistry is apparent in the way it perfectly frames the stars, while remaining out of the spotlight.The pastel-green juice gives the impression that Caron is a fresh, perhaps even green, aromatic summer scent. However, it is actually more of an oriental, with a sweet creaminess that makes it better suited to spring and autumn. That said, it is very versatile - you could wear this casually or with a suit. It's also quite unisex, in the same way Shalimar is a unisex scent. After the intense lavender opening, this would be a great women's fragrance.

Instead I was greeted with a complex musky and aromatic oriental, which fuses vanilla and lavender in an almost otherworldly, perhaps even alien blend. 2 years later and with more experience of the world of perfumery under my belt, I am astonished by the beauty of Pour un Homme. Now, it evokes memories of other perfumes that I love; perfumes with a fine Parisian pedigree, such as Shalimar.

It' true, the first 5 minutes or 10 minutes are not that great. Tolerable,sure, great? Not at all.Luckily the next phase is a true transformation to greatness. Every single time I'm baffled how this Lavender evolves to a gorgeous and masculine vanilla/musk base that is just mouthwatering and comforting. The difference with the opening couldn't be bigger. The base lives for quite a while but does it in a soft and silent way. You will often catch whiffs of this delicious scent but overall the projection is @ arms length and the scent trail is soft. In a way it's a more an ethereal thing that lingers in the air rather than a perfume you drag behind you. This fragrance shines when your loved ones are cuddling up in your arms or when people hug you. It's an honest fragrance, it's a romantic fragrance and under the right circumstances it's even a little bit sexy. On top of that it does all of that while still preserving masculinity. Yeah, maybe not in the macho way of masculinity but in the kind of masculinity that makes a man a man because he believes in honest values and knows what he wants.Amazing that this fragrance is so old.

It does smell somewhat like taste of heaven but less intense , less dark,less sweet and less deep and less warm. A lot more linear and watery , It's like taste but stripped of the heavy warm fuzzy deep aspect. The patchouli and Amber and tonka are missing to make this more rounded and longer lasting. It fleets rather quickly but it's enjoyable while it lasts. It's a nice one  to have, but I definitely prefer taste of heaven , this might be better in the hot weather during the day and then at night switch to Taste of heaven. If taste of heaven is a woollen blanket then Caron is a linen sheet. Or in other words , taste would be a more formal or date night sexy scent and Caron a more during the day casual fresh scent.

Three different instruments playing well together and keeping it natural and fresh, but as in a field under the sun not out of the shower or dryer. Think this could be used by women. It has zero of a men fume harshness. That lavender sharpness is softened quickly. A modern male may not find this trendy enough. An older gentleman may find this quite appealing.

Basically the illustrious Pour Un Homme de Caron is defined from three notes, which are them, Lavender, the vanilla and musk, and here we already realize that your olfactory path, its evolution, will not be anything, because of these three notes being practically a \"masterpiece\" for the fragrance when they appear in the olfactory pyramid of a fragrance. Its opening is a horse dose of Lavender, that reminds us to the interior smell of barber shop, where the man smell of amalgam to the smell of products for the care of the man, who for the most part, they carry the same aromatic content of Lavender this fragrance brings in its opening. After a 4 h with the power of antiseptic aromatic content that Lavender has to transmit in perfumery, Pour Un Homme de Caron reverberates a fantastic presence for the emergence of vanilla, remembering that it is not a gourmand vanilla, as the classic here came from 30\\'s decade, but a vanilla earthy, masculine, which in a step to daydream comes to exhale pure testosterone, something kind of close to the rubberized transcending the figure of a clean man besides using beard when he speaks his voice is more serious than the normal.

Its lavender is fresh, sweet, frighteningly naturalistic (especially at its price point), and truly calming. The vanilla, melded with a dab of civet into a powdery musk, is entirely inedible, cool, silky in feel, and truly powerful. I've read that Tom Ford wears this scent and brings it with him wherever he goes. It isn't hard to understand why. If you have scoured the fragrance universe in search of a signature that doesn't require mind-bending analysis to enjoy, and have not yet touched on the venerable house of Caron, do try Pour un Homme. Go for the little - or very big - green bottle. It's almost 80 years old, a survivor, the fundamental exception to every limiting rule ever penned about masculine fragrance.

       " 'PGHChris': 'The was the first \"classic\" (pre-1970) fragrance that I purchased.  I was turned on to it because my favorite shaving soap artisan had recreated the original Mousse de Saxe base that Caron had used for so many of their fragrances.  He used it to make a shaving soap that was as close in scent to the original Pour un Homme de Caron as it could be, and from the first time I lathered that soap up I was hooked.  I immediately purchased PuHdC and am still in love with it.  Regardless of the fact that the version I own is not the same as the vintage versions that did contain the wonderful Mousse de Saxe base, it is still a fantastic fragrance.  It starts out with a sharp, wet blast of herbal lavender, and in about 15 minutes calms down and rounds out to smooth lavender, sweet vanilla, and a touch of clean musk; that\\'s it.  Elegant, simple, and genius (in my humble opinion).  It is miles away from what the standard \"men\\'s\" fragrances of today smell like, but it is still incredibly relevant.  A lot of newer fragrances seem to be an all-out assault on the olfactory system of everyone around; I don\\'t know if that\\'s the way they are created, or if its because the droves of young folks who all douse themselves with the same fragrance.  In a world where this \"assault\" is the norm, Caron Pour un Homme is a true breath of fresh air, in its understated simplicity.  I\\'m sure this fragrance wasn\\'t the first one to use this model, but it is absolute proof that just a few notes, blended well, can be substantially more endearing and approachable than those note-pyramids that have 15-20 different elements.  This gem is one that I\\'ll have in my collection forever; I can\\'t imagine a time in my life that I would not enjoy this. Apr 06 2015',\n",

I almost detect a spiciness to it, though i\\'m not sure why...I also feel a \"tea-like\" vibe when the fragrance starts to settle, which I attribute to the therapeutic properties of the lavender. To me, it is masculine. It\\'s classic, and one of the oldest fragrances to date, yet it\\'s nowhere near dated. It doesn\\'t have the note breakdown to make it dated. I think this can be worn anytime, but Spring, Summer and Fall seem most suitable. Casual or formal, doesn\\'t matter. This is also an excellent fragrance to wear to bed. I will say, that if you haven\\'t tried this yet, and are looking to blind buy, beware of the sweet vanilla in the base. The lavender stays present all throughout, but eventually turns sweet.

The vanilla and musk are gentle basenotes which for my tastes just make a boring and unimaginative backdrop for the potency of lavender.My examples being... yes this is similar to Taste of heaven but at least that has a little more interest in other notes like absinthe and prominent vanilla. Or Eau de L'occitane which again has that super realistic lavender but also has a woody, peppery, hardness to dirty up the lavender a bit.I would never wear a fragrance so linear and even the beauty of lavender can become annoying and headache inducing after a while.Sorry but this is yet another classic I can't abide.

In comes a unique vanilla note that over the course of an hour develops into one of the most warm and inviting vanilla scents I have encountered. That to some may not be saying much, but I really like how it grows from a straight vanilla to a deep and almost Gourmand Vanilla that just makes you feel good (think comfort food). There is also more to this than the musk note in the base as well though as I said earlier I just can't describe it.... I can only guess as this scent has been around since 1934 and uses the base of Mousse de Saxe that these unique vanilla/leather/musk scents stem from this iconic compound. The lavender is so fleeting I really don't consider this a lavender scent except as I said for about 20 seconds before it evolves.

What I love about it, is that it strikes a fine balance between herbal, smooth, and sweet... and in no way is it ever cloying or offensive, it\\'s just beautifully and masterfully done!To me, this is classic French sophistication in a bottle.

It starts off a little herbal and has a green, unlit cigarette  tobacco like  note in the begining. I have no idea what it is since tobacco is not listed but after that it settles down into a very comfortable, slightly sweet and powdery,lavender and vanilla blend. It stays pretty much that way until some musk creeps in during the dry down. projection is restrained and longevity is a good 5-6 hours on me and my clothes smell of it the next day. A very relaxing, sweet powdery frag, kind of dandified, from the time when men knew they were men and did not need woody notes in their frags to proclaim it so!

Sweet syrup vanilla. It's very linear, but the playdoh smell everyone gets only lasts for about 30 minutes. After that, it lasts a long time, with close to skin projection, but you feel it all day long. People near you feel it when in close range.Quality smell and linear, but not simple. Inexpensive, also, for what you get.You have to give it some time to understand it.By the way, the vanilla I get of this in my skin is very similar to a mixture between the vanilla smell of Bvlgari Black and A*Men. Really weird, but good for me. Apr 02 2014\",\n",

       " 'Redbeard': 'I\\'m approaching this again with some trepidation, me not being a fan of lavender or powdery notes, and merely tolerating vanilla. Fortunately the opening lavender is already toned down enough (with powder!?) to not bother me with that sweatiness that it sometimes has, though it gets slightly worse before it gets better. However they\\'ve done it, what would normally come across as stinky armpit BO for me, becomes this strange, hollow, crisp planty aura, like a clear distillate of Christmas wreaths mixed with the sharp herbs of Yatagan. Until this point, the powder had faded away and was only detectable if I wiped the residue from the tip of my nose after sniffing. Finally, during the last gasps of the lavender, the powder is back with more vanilla. All that remains after a while is a clean, powdery vanilla, which could be perfectly unisex. It\\'s quite surprisingly light and airy, considering how many times I feel like I\\'ve been choked to death by vanilla or powder.One reviewer (MHV) noted below that CPUH is not a fragrance so much as a scent, which just \"is\", from the familiar scene of a man dilligently going about his routine, shaving and showering before work. In that role, I find this stuff much more believable than Rive Gauche, probably because it\\'s not an exact replica of one product\\'s scent (i.e. Barbasol coypcat). I agree that it\\'s very conservative, but as is sometimes the case, it\\'s so conservative, and from such a different time, that it\\'s almost anachronistic. While I\\'m not a fan of all the latest releases, this follows norms that are just so different from what we\\'d expect today, that I\\'m not sure I\\'d find it very practical over the long term. I should have used it many, many more times before writing this. It might make a really classy room spray though, and since they\\'ve done such a good job of making a fragrance that I sort of like out of notes that I normally don\\'t, I\\'ll give it a thumbs up.

       " 'Karenin': 'I´ve turned my nose to “Pour Un Homme de Caron” because it´s a classic masculine fragrance which, in spite of (no doubt) numerous reformulations, has stood the test of time, moving effortlessly across the decades and into the future. When it comes to its composition, “Pour Un Homme de Caron” is a straightforward fragrance. The two notes in the limelight here are lavender and vanilla. I detect a soft musky background in the base as well. The scent is light and unobtrusive, yet it has a pretty decent longevity. The lack of complexity legitimately attracts some criticism. I myself, for instance, prefer more full-bodied perfumes in the colder months of the year. But let´s face it. Aren´t there times when many of us find comfort in unpretentious, well-composed perfumes? As far as this function is concerned, “Pour Un Homme de Caron” does wonders.While there are heaps of fragrances that are claimed to be “timeless”, “Pour Un Homme de Caron” rightfully deserves this attribute. Not tied to any particular period, it still oozes refinement and natural elegance, and can be worn with a smart suit as well as a T-shirt and jeans. In my view, it works perfectly on a crisp spring or early summer morning, making the already fine day just a little bit more special... Happy 80th birthday, “Pour Un Homme de Caron”!

Initially I wasn\\'t all that warm about it, but now that it has worked on me for some time I feel differently. I have to say that this is the most sublime and serene male fragrance I\\'ve come across. It really could be worn by a woman too. But there\\'s a lack of sweetness that makes it more appealing for men.I\\'m not a fan of vanilla in fragrances (like to eat it though!) but in CPuH it is beautifully balanced with lavender and musk. Not too musky, not too vanilla, and just enough lavender. Elegant simplicity. Leaves you feeling fresh/clean. Longevity is somewhat short as this is more of a skin scent than a cologne/EdT, but moisturize first and layer... and you\\'ll get a good 8 hours--just enough for the day. Or, carry a small spray bottle with you. And yes, sillage is rather close. This is a scent for you, not for people surrounding you.  ;-)I haven\\'t tried the new formulation, but I\\'m told it is fairly close and still quite nice (and of course, cheaper). Vintage wise, there does seem to be a small but fairly steady flow of inventory. One member here told me he layers both vintage and new.  9.1/10 for vintage.ADDENDUM:On my recent frag-crawl through lower Manhattan, I had the chance to sample \"A Taste of Heaven\" by Kilian at Aedes. It was my favorite among the 5 other Kilian frags I\\'d sampled.  Is it a clone of CPuH?  I\\'d say no... but more intense and sweeter.  If TOH is a parfum, CPuH is a cologne.  I\\'d rather just layer more CPuH than go the expensive of TOH.  :-) Dec 24 2013',\n",

       " 'fragscape': 'I want to start off my review by explaining where I come from with fragrances and why I love them.I cant speek for everyone here on Fragrantica when I say this, but im sure others feel the same.Fragrance for me, and throughout my life, has always been an escape from the real world.  When I wear any of the fragrances in my wardrobe, I put on a persona,a life, a theme, making that day a little more interesting than what it would have normally been.Caron Pour Un Homme does this for me to the max.It just so happends that when I first became aquainted with PUH, my wife was really into the \"Downton Abbey\" series (And still is). As I watched the Episodes with her and met all the different characters I couldnt help but think \"What would it smell like in that house?/ What whould they smell like?\" Really enjoying the characters of Lord Grantham and Mathew Crawley, I wanted to find the scent that would fit them perfectly.Looking into my fragrance collection I found a good group of fragrance that could fit the bill.(Nothing from that time period but fits the theme)Polo Green Eau SauvageSafari4711Guerlains Vetiverect......Though they are great fragrances and do fit the bill for me, they weren\\'t the perfect fragrances. Until I looked in a small corner of my cabinet and saw three samples of PUH.I, like many, was put off by the opening notes of Lavender. Felt really old (PUH is far from old, it just felt like it at the time). But I wasn\\'t mature enough in fragrances to really appreciate it for what it was when I first ordered it. In a few adjectives I\\'d describe it as:Noble EdwardianElegantHigh ClassSimple (Humble)Vanilla and LavenderNow, wearing it and watching downton abbey completely adds to the experience of the smell.  And that is why I love fragrance. Everytime I put this beautiful fragrance on (In my mind) I become a high class englishman with an estate like that of downton abbey or biltmore (in North Carolina). It raises the spirit and puts a little nobilty in your step. (I know.... Im crazy right)I know I havent described the fragrance in detailed notes, but anybody can say vanilla,lavender, and musk. I dont judge fragrances by how they smell, rather... how they feel. Oct 25 2013',\n",

It's that sweet, vanillary lavender that has me in a trance.If I had my way, all men would own at least one lavender scent. I just love the way this note smells on a man's skin. With that being said, I love the way it smells on me too. I'm half inclined to buy myself a bottle of Pour Un Homme de Caron. Why should guys have all the fun?I realise that some men may be turned off by the sweetness of this fragrance, even the somewhat powdery, musky base may act as a deterrent. That's understandable. Caron Yatagan is so rugged and manly when compared to Pour Un Homme de Caron, they're complete opposites.Pour Un Homme de Caron is an incredibly soothing scent, perfect for the warmer weather. I think the scent is unique enough to turn a few heads, and is even something that could interest the ladies. Take note boys.I know a few women who wear and own Pour Un Homme de Caron, and honestly I will more than likely be joining them. This scent is too good to pass up. It's a must for all lavender fans.

The aromatic lavender exudes spice, sweetened and softened by the vanilla. He is undeniably masculine, generous of spirit and good with kids. He has a labrador at home, goes for a run in the misty winter mornings and truly loves his wife. Pour Un Homme reads classic fiction, asks himself the big questions, and isn't afraid of the answers.The simple structure of this cologne does not make it boring. Far from it, it makes it honest, trustworthy. This is a grown man's cologne. A man in his 20's could wear it, but only if he was mature. A teenager would seem ridiculous, like a child in his dad's suit, wearing something as sophisticated as this.Longevity is better in cold weather for this, lasting 5-6 hours, and projection is about arm's length after the first hour.

I wear the vintage version with the black plastic cap (1960s?), which is more herbal than the current vintage. Clary sage top notes that burn off quickly to lavender and eventually to vanilla, remaining smooth and creamy throughout. This is a very gentle fragrance that makes me feel clean and happy, and it lasts for hours. It goes with food, it goes in the open air or in the house. It never gets above its station, it's just a lovely fragrance. Why it's a masculine is beyond me, I must say - it's softer than Habanita, for instance. I've tried this on one wrist with Gris Clair on the other and they couldn't be more different. Gris Clair is addictive but far more of a challenge with its smoky toilet-cleaner topnotes, while the Caron is far better behaved and as comfy as a worn-in pair of beige suede shoes. Yummy.

       " 'Bigsly': 'I agree with those who say things like this smells like burnt plastic, but only for the recent formulation.  I have the Les Plus Belles Lavandes EdT version (the liquid is lightly tinted with a dull green), which I don\\'t think was produced beyond the 1960s.  I tried the new one several times over the course of the last four years but hated it every time (seemed way too \"synthetic), but I decided to give the vintage formulation a chance based upon my experiences with these old formulations.As in just about all other cases, the vintage version is great.  It is quite simple, like the new version, but the \"complexity\" comes from the ingredient quality in this case.  The lavender is crisp and clear, and while it does have a bit of that burnt quality that one can find with lavender notes, this is light and natural, making it more compelling.  The vanilla also smells great, and over time it becomes more prominent while the lavender becomes less prominent.  Eventually, they sort of \"meet in the middle.\"  There\\'s also a bit of an animalic quality but it\\'s smoother than in the new version.As an aside, anyone who thinks that Caron would sell something with the quality of the vintage version I have at their current prices doesn\\'t understand the costs involved (this is based upon industry people I\\'ve spoken to) so keep that in mind when you see a \"great deal\" on a reformulated classic.  I can swap up to half ounce decants of my vintage version for those who are really interested in it.  It\\'s fairly strong for a few hours and then becomes a skin scent.  Also over time it takes on a bit of a powdery quality.My old review (which was of the new version): This is another one I tried to like over a period of years now, yet I always have come to the same conclusions. After top notes that I don\\'t like at all (not \"natural\" smelling to me), the vanilla and lavender come together as a \"blob\" that is irritating (I\\'m guessing due to ingredient quality). Later on, there is an animalic aspect, and then later a floral/woody one I perceive as clearly \"synthetic.\" I wonder if higher-quality ingredients would make a difference here, or it may be that it\\'s just too simple for me. And on top of this, I think of women\\'s fragrances when I smell this, even though I wear a bunch of women\\'s fragrances myself (they don\\'t strike me as especially \"feminine\"). This is \"old school\" too, so if you don\\'t like those kinds of fragrances I don\\'t see a need to sample this one. By contrast, I\\'d much rather wear Roadster, which replaces the lavender with mint and has a few more notes that are clear. It\\'s also more \"natural\" smelling to me, and not \"old\" (and certainly not \"feminine\" smelling either). Third Man is more interesting (with no \"off\" notes) to me, though it\\'s also rather simple, so I suggest sampling that one before CPUH if you want to sample Caron\\'s men\\'s fragrances and want something in the sweet/floral area. If you have skin chemistry that really \"eats up\" a fragrance, perhaps this can work for you, but for me, a fragrance can\\'t get much more cloying than this! Oct 05 2012',\n",

       " 'anomie et ivoire': 'For the pre-recent-reformulaton edt (~90s?): The older version of Pour Un Homme de Caron is the fragrance I wear and enjoy most often and to most reliable satisfaction. It lends itself to lavish spritzes on linens before sleep, a spray on a scarf for comfort\\'s sake before travel, or splashing on generously after a shower to transition from cleanliness to stimulation. I go through about .25 oz/week gladly, as even in vintage this is very affordable. The only reasons I prefer the vintage are: superior lasting power and a more pleasing lavender. Otherwise the current formula is quite comparable, if not in abstractly felt-for \"quality,\" then in its basic smell and impression.This Caron lasts most of the day if sprayed 2-3 times but is more enjoyable if refreshed every few hours. The sillage is noticeable but soft and alluring, not demanding or try-hard. Pour Un Homme, Femme, both, neither: wear it to experience lavender as a natural magic: of sparkling solidity and shifting light; a geode. Tonka-vanilla and musk are allowed each their own space and freedom to become colors, textures, feelings, ever-sharpened ideas instead of the white noise they\\'re reduced to in most other scents. A doughy-rich amber shows up frequently on repeat wearings while a camphorous mint makes a very occasional appearance before drydown. Cold/warm contrasts edge out too much focus on sweetness, though the ice cream feeling mentioned in other reviews is evident just before the warmer drydown.This is the meaning of the word elegance: simplicity, though not simple. Pour Un Homme is perfume\\'s answer to Ezra Pound\\'s \"In A Station of the Metro\" in form, function, near-perfection while dismissing the need for perfection, in being so direct, so alive.

Amazing!This masterpiece is only to be avoided when one really hates lavender or vanilla.If not, this is a must buy!It is mainly a three note composition of lavender, vanilla and musk but so well blended that it is rightfully considered as a masterpiece!It opens with a fresh blast of lavender which smells very pure! Shortly after the raw vanilla (which is indeed not sweet) kicks in surrounded by musk which makes this frag pretty unique, very fresh and clean! During the base the vanilla and musk take over on the lavender but the moment this happens is difficult to point out! It's that well blended. the frag gives you a clean, fresh feeling and is perfect for casual wear during the morning in spring or summer after you showered! Longevity is average (6 hrs) and sillage is from  above average to average during the course of wearing time. An advantage is that this can be applied in different ways; over-apllication for huge sillage (at first) and decent longevity if one wants this for as long as possible or just a few sprays to start the first morning hours in a very fresh but warm way! It never gets cloying and is pretty inoffensive as it is not a sweet fragrance. For 30+ years and up! Rated: 8.5/10 Sep 01 2012\",\n",

The whole effect is something akin to the smell of my grandmother's cedar linen cabinet, always stocked with Yardley English Lavender soap.

I was always so hesitant to pull out my wallet and actually go through with purchasing a scent that was crafted in the 1930's but I desperately desired to try a fragrance from the Caron house. With that, I'm ecstatic that I added this classic to my collection! The fragrance itself has more than 3 notes, fragrantica missed a few, but overall, it's simple with what it presents and is beautifully executed in the process. I won't lie, the opening is almost revolting and when I first sprayed it on myself, I was instantly drawn away. To my nose, the earthy aspect in the opening blended with the citrus and spice, although appealing in theory, is overwhelmingly odd. The rosemary is too potent and the lemon is sharp while a soft lavender slowly makes a subtle arrival. Anyway, for about 15 minutes, I was shaking my head in disappointment when all the sudden, I sensed a delicate waft of vanilla and lavender that warped my olfactory cells entirely. It was something that reminded me of one of my all time favorites, Le Male by JPG. I sniffed around and couldn't find the source of this glorious aroma when I realized it was I! The scent became a whole different fragrance! The mid and base are a combination of sugared florals interwoven with rich cedar and rosewood. The marriage of both vanilla and lavender is pure with absolutely no distortion of any other notes overpowering the two.            They are exclusive and faithful to one another and their roles in Pour Un Homme illustrates just that. Think of a powdery vanilla ice cream cone threaded with fresh lavender. That's how this smells like to me. It ends with a white musk/tonka bean synthesis that attempts to divide the lovers but their fidelity remains far too enduring.As lovely as this is, it's not for everyone and definitely is difficult to pull off in the warmer months and casually at that. The elegance in the scent is quite superior to most mass market fragrances. It's also quite unisex so women needn't fret to test this magnificent juice. For some reason, I can't help but wonder if Jean Paul Gaultier was inspired by this Caron classic. All Le Male fans should at least give this fragrance a wearing to further identify with my statement. Top notch stuff! Apr 02 2012\",\n",

There is a sharpness which I do not generally find in lavender perfumes such as Guerlain Aqua Allegoria LAVANDE VELOURS, which I sometimes use as a bedtime scent to induce sleep.POUR UN HOMME does mellow out after a bit, but to my nose, it's always fairly strident lavender sweetened with vanilla, from start to finish.A question: am I mistaken, or is that a man fondling a woman's breast in one of the ad photos above?!

About five minutes later, a \"musky\" vanilla appears and it is this smell that remains on my skin, brilliantly, for the rest of the evolution.Many say: \"if you like vanilla, you will love this perfume!\". Well, I love vanilla, but I must say: never expect a typical vanilla scent (creamy) by wearing Pour Un Homme, because it is not like Rochas Lui, for example, which is one of the best vanilla I have ever felt in men\\'s perfumes. In this fragrance from Caron, you will find one calmer and slightly powdery vanilla, which is neither too sweet nor too strong.

Every bit of the balance that I find so delicious and enticing in Jicky is out of whack in Pour un Homme.  The lavender and the vanilla never come together and the other elements I can find are on the sidelines urging on the fight.Rosemary curdles the vanilla and tonka blunts the lavender.

It\\'s pretty romantic to think of all the decades this fragrance outlived - definitely timeless.On paper, Pour Un Homme is the truest lavender I\\'ve EVER smelled. It isn\\'t the soothing lavender that would put you to sleep (like on Covet), though. This lavender is sharply aromatic and invigorating and STRONG. It settles down after a few minutes, and thank you rafaeleleniz for identifying the rosemary! It\\'s definitely there. The strong herbs straddle fresh and medicinal in an abstract modern personality. An hour in, the vanilla becomes detectable. Wait another hour and the vanilla takes the lead. The combination of vanilla and lavender is divine. I much prefer this vanilla to the candy-sweets in gourmand scents.I don\\'t understand why Pour Un Homme isn\\'t unisex - the strong opening is very masculine, but the sweet drydown wouldn\\'t be unpleasant on a woman.Interestingly, the lavender that smells so good on paper does bizarre things on my skin. My skin makes the lavender smell sour, reminding me of the \"scented\" shampoo/soap provided by cheap motels. I don\\'t understand it, very frustrating! I paitiently bear it until after half an hour when the delicious vanilla comes in to redeem the herbal pungency of the opening. I wear men\\'s fragrances, and never encountered this on my skin before. Nice, but on the right skin chemistry. Jan 07 2010',\n",

The base shows a faint mossy scent that enhances and elevates the musk to extraordinary heights.  There are more subtle notes in this fragrance that unfortunately I do not have the knowledge to properly describe, this scent is much more complex that the simple description in this page.

I think the silage doesn't stay that close to the skin, people should smell you wearing it. and lasts long enough to not be dissapointed. It's very sweet compared to my other more manly fragrances and definitely smells pretty unique, and as time goes on I think the sweet vanilla is dominant. but it's pretty comfortable to wear as long as you're ok with sweet fragrance, and you like vanilla, and you don't over apply it. I think it smells nicer if I don't over apply it. I like the fact that it comes from 1934, if it was a modern fragrance I'd probably like it a bit less. The scent seems to keep changing every now and then when I apply it. sometimes it has a nice smell but occasionally I'll spray it and it'll smell a bit different to usual and a bit weird. generally I like it and have grown to like it more and more Aug 05 2009\",\n",

       " 'Luna_J': \"I picked up a small sample of this at the improbably old-world, third-floor Caron boutique in New York [edit: since moved on]... In my memory, the smell of lavender is now layered over all of that urbanity, but surviving impressions are: yes, the play dough accord at the start, but (also yes) that association vanishes quickly. This scent very rapidly insinuates itself into your sensibility, more so than almost anything I've tried, it becomes a second skin of (what best sums this up?) bonhomie, confidence, 'oldworldmasculinity', comfort, with a little of (great phrase from Gatsby), 'romantic readiness'. You feel taken care of, if that makes sense. The combination of apparent simplicity with (also apparent, certainly to you) excellent construction seems like a piece of really lovely, expensive and well crafted but unpretentious tailoring made in a fabric that wears better as it ages (I have a charcoal grey flannel suit that is like this). Somehow after six days it had gone from reading as 'play dough' to a sort of sheer yet earthy, rosemary-infused oleos amber musk, like the lining of a suede jacket just as it drapes over your shoulders. The mix of cool and warm, earthy and sophisticated, and easy and refined is terribly simple, direct and nonetheless addictive and a little mysterious.

       " 'FatLipWill': '[Pour Un Homme de Caron]I’m starting to come to terms with the fact that Lavender just makes me nauseous and almost to the point of gagging. Caron Pour Un Homme being the biggest offender to date. I’ve owned a few lavender dominant fragrances from Eau de L’Occitane to Jicky and whilst liking a few, I’ve never considered them to be mind-blowing. I like lavender in a supporting role rather than the headliner in most cases. Pour Un Homme is to me a very dated fragrance. Now I’m not saying people cannot pull it off, but for my nose it screams early 20th century in the worst kind of way. It is also setting off some kind of forgotten olfactory memory but I cannot place it but it is worth mentioning. The fragrance begins very herbal and jarring however tones down within 5-10 minutes to create a very smooth and incredibly well blended scent. I cannot stress how well crafted this fragrance is even before considering it has been around since 1934. I highly respect the craftsmanship here.When compared to fragrances the likes of Shalimar, Bal À Versailles and even Aramis, Pour Un Homme is very much a victim of its time. The previous fragrances mentioned have aged incredibly gracefully and feel relatively contemporary even in today’s market. Like the ambroxen bombs of today in a generations time, Caron is let down by its complete faithfulness to ingredients and tropes of its day. While not for me, I understand that this fragrance is incredibly well made and a classic perfume. This fragrance has a very apparent cult following and I’m pleased to see that many love Pour Un Homme and keep Caron in the minds of many, so this legend isn’t left behind to time. I encourage people to at least seek out a sample even if only to add to your mental database. Apr 18 2020',\n",

The vanilla is softened as well. I would maybe have preferred something a little more complex, but it was interesting to try. Sillage is moderate. Apr 01 2020\",\n",

Once you get it, you will know that it is the musk you are smellingYou are welcome!P.S. This fragrance was or still is a signature scent of Thiery Wasser and Tom Ford.

       " 'Naughtius Maximus': 'This is the same vein as Shalimar Eau de Toilette. The only difference being that Shalimar is more powdery and sweet, while Pour Un Homme is powdery, but not overly sweet because there\\'s presence of rose, rosemary and lavender for the most part. Subtle, yet huge difference.Spray it on your hand and after about an hour exhale (hooh?) warm air onto the place you\\'ve sprayed and smell it. You will understand what I\\'m saying. The dominant rosemary and subtle rose will instantly kick in your nose. Old school shaving creme vibes.The musk isn\\'t animalic or off-putting. Very sophisticated, however in my experience it\\'s mostly for daytime/morning use. This doesn\\'t have the night time character for me because I strongly resemble my  success with the early, morning hours. When most are sleeping and you prepare yourself for work.I believe this is for more mature gentlemen (30+) who are shaving or trimming daily as I believe you have to be in that mood in order to truly reflect the way this fragrance was supposed to be worn. With old school manners, by old school appreciators. Unisex vibes? Not sure about that. To my nose it has a quite masculine herbal backbone. I don\\'t discourage other to try it, however - be aware.EDIT: Turns out this was featured in the movie \"American Psycho\" when Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) showed his morning routine, alongside YSL Pour Homme and Pour Lui.

As for the green liquid, it is misleading for there is NO green tone present in the aroma. I expected something barbershop-like, but Pour un Homme has nothing from barbershop, as there is no alcohol content or other typical macho-man notes. The end result of the heart refers to a simplified version of Musc Ravageur. Satisfactory power. Feb 09 2020',\n",

Given the mixed reviews, the positive reviews had put me at ease that I\\'d enjoy this fragrance.When it finally arrived, and was able to give it my first whiff, my initial response was \"wow this is amazing\" .. In the opening, I immediately detected the lavender, basically aromatherapy lavender, with a citrusy touch of bergamont or lemon alongside a subtle licorice type, and soft play-dough accord. I think I also detect sage and some woods, but it\\'s also perhaps the bitter lavender giving it a \"wet woodsy\" aroma. This fragrance is so beautifully crafted..the transition into the vanilla is smooth as you can begin to pick up a soft & subtle vanilla..elegant in simplistic fashion. It reminds me of a soap product from L\\'Occitane. After telling my mom what I had received for my birthday, she told me that my late grandfather used to wear this. I\\'m not surprised by this, because he was a man of taste. This is a fragrance that withstood the test of time for 86 years and is still going strong. It doesn\\'t smell dated, but rather natural..as long as you truly enjoy the notes of lavender and vanilla, you\\'ll most certainly enjoy this one. I\\'m still struggling to pick up the musk as it seems absent at least to my nose. That said, I find it contemporary, and very wearable. You\\'ll stand out in a nice way, and if people ask what you\\'re wearing, you can tell them it\\'s a fragrance from the 1930\\'s ;) ... This was also a signature scent of Tom Ford.This is the perfect fragrance to enter my 30s with..easily a 10/10. Feb 05 2020',\n",
       " 'Adair': \"I wanted to love this because of its history as the first true scent designed for men (1930's). Alas...the opening notes for me evoke urine or rash. My wife hated it, said it did not smell masculine. Once it dried down, it became tolerable, more lavender. I can't imagine a contemporary man wearing this--it smells quite dated, from an era with a different interpretation of masculinity. I shall decant into a sprayer and use it to perfume bed sheets and pillow covers--it is perfect for that. Feb 05 2020\",\n",

After a couple of minutes, it settles down into this PlayDoh accord (that I honestly find that endearing), but dries down into a Vanilla that isn’t sugary sweet, but refined and incense-like with a touch a Lavender.  A classic & understated fragrance. I believe this is what today’s men and women should wear.

Dec 12 2019\",\n",
       " 'Don Joe': 'Unlike many others, I do enjoy the strong medicinal opening, which is one of the reasons why I prefer to apply this to my clothes.If I put it on my skin, the lavender is completely gone within 3 minutes, followed by some 10-15 minutes of vanilla, and then I smell like my 95 year old great-great-aunt. Am I the only one to whom the musk in this fragrance smells like old people? Not really \"animalic\" or \"fecal\", just the smell of really old people.However, when I put this on my clothes, the lavender lasts longer and the transition between lavender and vanilla is smoother. So somewhere between the strong medicinal lavender, and the mild sweet vanilla, there are about 2-3 minutes of that truly amazing lavender-vanilla accord. And that\\'s it. After that, there\\'s only vanilla, and it stays on clothes for many days, albeit only as a \"skin\" scent (or rather cloth scent). And unless I spray many times on the same spot, I cannot smell any musk on my clothes.I\\'m kinda beginning to get this perfume. It doesn\\'t spoil you by giving you all the goodness at once and lasting for hours. It makes you wait for the right moment and appreciate it while it lasts, and then it\\'s just teasing of the vanilla sweetness left behind.One more thing about this prefume. There is absolutely nothing bad about it, nothing which I wouldn\\'t like (as long as I don\\'t put it on my skin). So many perfumes, as great as they may be, often give me headaches, or they literally hurt my nose, or they dry my throat or sting in my eyes... or I simply get tired of them after wearing them for a couple of hours. Or there\\'s just some ingredient, some chemical, some note which I don\\'t like. It may still be a very good perfume, but almost always there\\'s something which I don\\'t like about it, no matter how natural or expensive or niche the perfume is. Not with this one. It\\'s an extremely okay™ perfume, and I mean that in a good way. Nov 27 2019',\n",

I might be laying upon the scent with my memory of horrid scents but being honest, it does!Thank the stars that doesnt last long at all, perhaps a few seconds!For a short while, it remains with me as a good old fashioned mans scent, true lavender vibes, and as other posters have said, reminiscent of the roaring 20s. Sadly, that fades, kinda like the memories of the 20s (im not that old!)It ends up being a completely different beast. Almost Jekyl and Hyde this scent. It begins to take on that vanilla musk tone, and the lavender is totally and utterly gone.Wether thats a bad thing, i dont know, as the base tone on this is so much different, perhaps lavender notes mixed in would just muddy it.The end result is not BAD, just not expected. It falls into a similar grouping of scents that are abundant in my fridge, and doesnt....well....stand out.

       " 'ericrico': 'Something from another era - and it smells like it. This is, as another reviewer put it, more of a scent than a fragrance. Sharp lavender, musk and vanilla are the three components everyone focuses on, but there are a few more overtones (and undertones) in Caron Pour Un Homme. \"Minimalism is beauty in its simplest form\"...this holds true with this bottle of magical aromas.I find current formulation to be very refreshing if applied liberally or reapplied within 10-15 minutes of 1st application (layering increases the scent\\'s projection and longevity). The key is to spray very close to the skin (about 1\") to \\'stack the scent\\'. In current formulation, this allows the lavender to show its beauty and articulate its duality in the scent (leaf and floral). The effect is interesting - the vanilla is more potent in current formulation and the close application provides better longevity and true form of scent. Otherwise, I find that the notes separate and the richness of the composition is not nearly as well-presented. The vanilla dominates in current juice. Vintage formulation has more musk and sharp lavender (and overall less vanilla, although it is still an amazing drydown to a vanilla/musk & warm amber on the skin).My preferred method of applying this lush, comforting scent is to pour a generous amount into my cupped palm from my 750ml giant flacon and splash it on my neck, chest and arms.  The \"playdoh\" effect is minimalized and the lavender presents itself more.  Plus, it is a celebration of the classique methode of application for this timeless piece of olfactive art.Each and every wearing, I am immediately reminded that this is classic perfumery...undeniably and indisputably (regardless of formulation). It is the showcase of a gorgeous lavender soliflore, as it has both the sharp, herbal aspect of lavender leaf along with the soft and fragrant floral accord of the same stem. The vanilla picks up the floral quality of the lavender, which is soothing and has light sweetness...while the musk carries the herbal feeling of the lavender, creating balance and brilliant harmony in this divine composition and not allowing this great scent to be cloying.The longevity is not great but definitely adequate and above average (as it dries down and stays on your skin). You get a very nice fresh lavender aroma that intermingles with the warm vanilla/musk base for about 3-4 hours on my skin with decent projection. After that, it dries down a nice, radiant skin scent and lasts for another 4+ hours. A true classic...a gentleman\\'s scent from 1934 on the shelf today in my wardrobe. Caron, as a house, is simply top-shelf. A very non-mainstream line of fragrances (many unisex) that transcend time and olfactory notes that are atypically together or compositions that are tastefully unique. I will not get into all the other Caron fragrances I know, have and love.This is about a timeless scent - Caron Pour Un Homme. One should have this in their fragrance collection. It will be around, most likely, forever...and generations should pass this on. My rating is not in points - but in a thankful and gracious nod to Caron for keeping this great bottle around all these years. Merci! Apr 13 2019',\n",

Now, it is still a soliflore, so normally to appreciate it you need at least to like lavender.

Modern Jicky parfum sadly lacks both the complexity and the longevity of the original so I\\'m always searching for a good approximation of that. Most lavenders I can\\'t stand because when the lavender is buried in other things most of what comes through is the turpenic (I think that\\'s the right term.) and powdery aspects, the \"barbershop\" affect.Caron pour un Homme gets the lavender right. It\\'s fresh and light with an emphasis on the carmelized aspects, just gorgeous.Then I went in for a sniff before I went back and sprayed some more - uh oh!I have a complicated relationship with vanilla too. (What can I say, I\\'m a complicated woman.) I love a dark, boozy, unsweetened vanilla. Modern aromachemical vanillas that smell like cupcakes have me running for the hills. That first sniff was enough to set of my cupcake alarms.Over time though, pour un Homme and I settled in nicely. I wound up spraying on some more and the vanilla and lavender balanced each other harmoniously. Eventually, the lavender gave way to the middle which was a fairly sweet vanilla but not cupcake-y. Overall, I found it comforting and well done. My son said I smelled good, an unheard of concession.The longevity and projection were moderate and I enjoyed it the whole time. It\\'s the sort of thing that would be good for giving to little girls who beg for a spritz from their mothers dressing table or to spray on linens warm from the sun or dryer.The ad campaign is hilariously inapt. Have the marketing people ever smelled this stuff? Nothing could be farther from the rugged guy and sex sex sex pictures. I\\'m picturing grandmothers, babies and clear blue skies. Jul 08 2018',\n",
       " 'missm2u': \"I'm a vintage House of Caron junkie, so even though this scent was designed for a man, when I was looking for a good lavender perfume, I had to give Pour un Homme a try.  To me it's more of a unisex fragrance.  The vanilla is really strong and the mixes completely with the lavender, and then it all dries down to a nice, long lasting powder.  I'd imagine not every woman could carry it off, but if you love lavender, this has it all over the BBW lavender vanilla aromatherapy line. I like to give myself a spritz at bedtime and then refresh it in the morning.  Such a lovely, relaxing frag. Jun 13 2018\",\n",

Actually smells of real Lavender essential Oil, which may surprise some who may not have experienced it directly.Good quality Lavender EO can be a complex fragrance on it's own and it's a real treat to have a gargantuan spray bottle of this at hand whenever the mood strikes!This is a truly classic cologne style scent. Delicate compared to most modern, off the shelf stuff; but done so well it's no wonder it still sells since 1934.The Lavender opening is soft and quickly enveloped by a creamy non-sweet vanilla note that cordially settles onto an equally good and not-too-sweet musk cloud that recycles the entire three note ensemble noticeably for a good hour or more and then you will get a hint of it yourself only; but others are well aware of it should they get close enough. They will inevitably move closer to you to get more of what you're carrying.Overspray is unlikely and I've already had bizarre daydream fantasies of filling an entire tub with the huge bottles available and dipping into it everything I own in sequence until my entire life is infused with this scent.

One thing that does stand out is how soft it settles.  Lasts forever, but sits very close to the skin/clothes.  This is one of those that I recommend applying liberally to give it some projection. For me, 6 sprays and even a few on shirt for good measure and you are still good with this one.  Highly recommend, there is a reason it is still around after almost 100 years. Apr 12 2018',\n",
       " 'Judespeak': \"As others with cooler heads have observed, this scent is not suitable for a blind buy. I just made that mistake. It was on sale, so how could I go wrong? I had really been wanting something super old-school. Well. Pour un Homme de Caron is certainly old-school. As in old, dusty, sexless school headmistress. Sweet and powdery. Clingy and confining like synthetic beige panties. Synthetic, and not in a cool way. The shame of it is that it lasts forever! and my body absolutely consumes scents. There was one point during the dry down, like 6 hours in, that I thought, you know, maybe theres potential here. The creaminess that has been mentioned here was happening. But for the rest of its development phase---pure feminine hygiene product. That tiny window is not worth hours of headache inducing, sickly sweet, bed-and-breakfast bed linen refresher.Edit Jun 2018: I have evolved on this at 6 months; I don't know why it provoked such a negative reaction from me, to the point I even hid it in the closet. This week on a hot night I got it out and sprayed it after bath and was still wary, but it felt cooling and slightly medicinal. Powdery, creamy, vanillic  lavender, still sweet but not quite as sickening as before. I would love to try a vintage version to see if it's less ... something. Apr 09 2018\",\n",
       " 'elGonzo': \"Doesn't smell like 1930's at all... it's more like a cologne from the 1800's, in fact I totally see Napoleon bathed in this thing.Bad jokes aside, I like several perfumes from the 70's and even tried and liked some Diors vintage for women (70's formulation maybe), but this one has some raw qualities that even in its newest edition sents me  to other times with its out worldlies nuances... Quite ironically the ingredients seems pretty natural, but again, the whole composition comes out in a way that doesn't make me want to spray (splash) myself in under any circumstances to be brutally honest.A must try (before even thinking of buying).

All of them balanced and very unique.The medicinal, bright and sharp lavender is soon tempered by the vanilla taking the bite off while it in turn tones down the sweetness in perfect equilibrium. Much later the musk combines with the vanilla into a hypnotic combination. At no point do any of these elements, that by themselves could be problematic, shout aloud or take over.For the price, it's alchemy at its finest. Feb 21 2018\",\n",

       " 'BoxOfRain23': 'Addendum: I was much too casual and flippant in my original review below.  Pour Un Homme de Caron is a dynamic and complex lavender fragrance that uses simple ingredients to create a lasting and superb composition.  The first ten minutes are \"revolutionary,\" meaning the explosion of medicinal like qualities, the collision of lavender and vanilla and the wet dog foundation can lead a wearer to think they\\'ve landed in the wizard\\'s lab.  It can be unsettling and off putting.  But wait.  Wait for the \"evolutionary\" phases to take hold where the rush of individual ingredients start blending harmoniously, working their magic and creating a beautiful and resonant whole.  Simple ingredients blended and executed masterfully!  Indeed, the blend of lavender, vanilla and musk leaves me with the feeling of finishing up in the barber\\'s chair.

       " 'RJ Watson': \"This is a beautiful lavender scent; simple and understated without ever feeling basic.A lovely grade of aromatic lavender, superbly blended with a warm vanilla and musk base, taking it ever-so-slightly in the oriental direction.While Caron officially lists just three notes now, it was slightly more complex in its heyday and I think today's version lies somewhere in between.  I definitely sense some herbal tones, courtesy of rosemary and even some rosewood.Anyone who enjoys Jicky but are put off by the dirty diaper accord (aka civet)  should give this an honest try.

       " 'gedlive': \"I have the other two most popular Caron's, Yatogan, and Le 3man. I had purchased this 2 years ago, and had a spoiled bottle and didn't know it, so I dismissed it as unlikeable frag.Delving into unisex florals I purchased SL Gris Clair, an aufull harsh spicy lavender, but in reading the reviews, I heard people recommending Caron Pour Homme.I'm very glad I gave it another try. I can feel comfortable as a man wearing this classy masculine lavender. I love woody, earthy smelling frags. This lavender is very earthy and natural smelling, the flower with the leaves and twigs mixed in. The vanela and musc ad a refined touch. I love the simplicity. I feel the same way about wearing Caron Le 3 man in the winter time. Le3 is warmer and richer, better suited for the cold. Pour Homme has a similar feel, but lighter, and can be used in Spring and Summer.I've been reading reviews here that mention notes not listed, like Tonka, coumarin, etc. I think they know what they're talking about because I also thought I was getting a bit of woods and something fresh and almost citrusy, like lemon grass perhaps. I liked the image that someone mentioned of an older gentleman on a metro in France, you may often come across wearing Caron Pour Homme. A great simple, fresh classic.Note: Yes, on basenotes they list 12 notes. I do notice the Tonka, lemon, and a great note, Clary sage. The Clary sage is quite prominent I see now, at first I thought it was an aspect of the lavender I was smelling.This is my signature scent for now, for it's beautifull aromatic, floral simplicity and versatility. The citrusy note just blends into an accord with the lavender, making it a refreshing warm weather frag.Rating: 9/10Happy Easter.  John 3:16. Mar 25 2016\",\n",

This is a very gentlemanly fragrance, for which I have appreciation for the history and introduction to men's perfumery.  This scent set a foundation for where we are today, but I think if  Ernest Daltroff knew that this would evolve mens fragrances to the likes of One Million, he might be shocked.  Definitely not a blind buy for young men, because it is fairly mature. Dec 12 2017\",\n",

I love lavender but not vanilla and its the only thing that makes me not buy a full bottle. It starts off with a very authentic lavender but unfortunately a very sweet though very natural vanilla takes over pretty soon and pushes lavender to background and that kills it for me.

But later on, as I was walking on the sweet vanilla came through, and the cheerful aroma followed me the rest of day. It was lovely. I purchased it later when I was back from holiday, as it reminded me of the sunny December trip.This perfum is not pretentious. It does not constantly remind me that i am wearing a perfum.

       " 'Yup$ki': \"I recently tried the Caron house and was pleasantly surprised. First ones I tried were Yatagan and Anachist...THIS and finally Le 3 Homme. After sampling these I like them all but primarily the first 3 mentioned. The aromas of these made me 'think' , upon hitting the senses. They smell authentic and classic, taking you back to a certain time/setting perhaps. To my nose, this doesn't smell like playdoh but I see the comparison. It actually reminds Me ,of two things. One is, that stick of gum that came in the wax packs of those Garbage Pail Kids or sports cards. I was all over those like flies on dogshit back in the early to mid eighties..so, that's the 'time era' it make me feel. The other would be Pinaud scented barber talc. So not bad at all! It will always be in my collection. I feel that you gotta have a certain appreciation for classic scents, to fully appreciate this. I actually held off on this one, thinking it might smell  a bit TOO dated..leaving one no choice but to smell like everyones grandpa, hah! But as others mention it's been around for this long for a reason. Very versatile juice. Lasts on my skin, 6 hours or so. On my shirts, a few days. I rock it casual from time to time for nostalgia or before bed. Enjoy!!UpdateWow this stuff is good!!!  Doesn't get stale at all..stays pretty linear.  Knowing this stuff was introduced in 1934, it blows my mind how it's still so readily available at the affordable price ot bears.  However i don't understand how the intense goes for such a high price..SMH!  When wearing this it always feels like stepping into a time machine, assuming there wasn't as much (for men) to select from back then.  So this is simply what 'a man' would wear..or one of say 5-10 contemporary colognes back then, as only the rich and well to do wore colognes back then.  But whatever the era or living class, if this was the only one i owned it would have been a pleasure.  If i could match this with an image/movie scene , it would be Ricky Ricardo coming home to Lucy or Marlon Brando in Streetcar Named Desire. Aug 21 2017\",\n",

I'm so glad I did. It's the truest lavender hit straight off the bat and I get something minty or very herbal I can't quite identify. The whole initial blasts feel like I've smelt it before but I think that's because it's just such a true lavender. And the dry down is utterly sublime. I adore it. Can't stop sniffing my arm. Soft, ethereal,  'your skin but better' scent. On the first day I'm almost prepared to say it's going to surpass my love for  eau sauvage and shalimar. And I can't believe I'm typing this. Ok I'll give it time, but it seems to have everything I want. I just got a big 100ml and I'm already thinking about stocking up. Utter madness!  It's completely captivating. Jul 17 2017\",\n",

The opening is an explosion of super sweet lavendar vanilla, like you've jumped from several stories up into a massive floral marshmallow. It is a bit old fashioned as it was first made before the advent of the jet engine, but IMO its simplicity is its strength. Make no mistake, if you don't like lavender you should definitely no make this a blind-buy, try it out first or smell it on someone you know.This is lavender and vanilla in big handfuls, and its as sweet as that implies. It's even more of a gourmand than I'd expected, with the lavender toning down a bit by the drydown to fall more in balance with the vanilla and musk (and wind up more powdery than sweet) - but that opening is certainly one of the sweetest experiences in my collection. I really like this, but warm weather is probably not the best time, so I will be putting this into the fall-winter box.Yatagan is next - here's hoping Caron can go 4-for-4. Jul 14 2017\",\n",

Now I have come to the point of getting a 200ml flacon and kicking a... with it!!!- An ever chic, timeless classic; Yet great for modern era as well.- Pampering, calming and tranquilizing.- Delicious and sweet as cookie.  Really feels edible.- By no means appears offensive or huge at all, even if overworn.  I whiffed once over 30 puffs at once and yet felt flying through a cloud of joy!!Just a very exceptional character, not like most others.  Never cloying and giving you headache or nose pain.  On the contrary, with any single sniff, it brings joy, relaxation and elegance.Starting up with a very calming strong lavender burst in quite natural and superb quality manner.  Though it\\'s totally understandable for those whom would complain the aquatic overdone part here, not matching the warm sweet notes of vanilla, amber and musk.  But no worries: very soon it\\'ll descend from the tip of the pyramid to get harmonized with other elements of the frag, as drying down.Soon, the soft dry powdery sweet blasts of vanilla would hit up with amber and musk.  The musk is a bit too intense, I can tell, but yet not cloying at all.And finally the soft light sweetness of vanilla mixed with musk remains plus escorted by a touch of cinnamon and I guess rose is also flying over.  The journey goes almost linear.  This frag is all the way so clean and executive as royal.The sweetness almost totally fades away within 12 hours, while the stubborn powdery notes still remain, but so soft and close.The longevity on my skin appeared moderate, but the projection is weak and that\\'s why I mentioned \"EXCEPTIONAL\" scent.  For such a scent, to me, it\\'s the beauty of being present but in the background, like it\\'s always faithful to you but never bothering shuffling around you.  It serves you like Siri or Google assistant!I would ideally use it firstly for spring time, then fall, winter and finally summer.  It\\'s versatile enough to be worn on heat, but maybe too sweet for those huge heat wave days.The bottle built quality and finishing all are a proof of a high quality French masterpiece, yet shining as the eye apple of Caron.All in all, I would give it the grades like this:- Scent:  9/10 (considering it was made in 1934, when the chemical tech. was in such a point)- Longevity:  6/10 (yet a good thing, knowing it\\'s a pre-WW2 formula!! and is 85% Vol., which appears sensibly more diluted than nowadays products)- Projection:  3/10- Price is amazingly attractive, so you may liberally and lavishly use it!

       " 'MIWBUTT': \"Before you ever smell this classic that will reveal a great many notes in other fragrances you have smelled, there is first and foremost one thing you should know: Pour un Homme de Caron is a very deceptive fragrance. The first many tries you will have with PuHdC if you are like me and afraid to spray that much more than a spray on each arm due to the crazy strength, then this fragrance will exclusively be that vanilla lavender play-dough bomb your parents warned you about. But, if you don't give up on this doll just yet, there are two other things that will occur that will reveal a lot about this fragrance to you. The first of these two things is that you will try other fragrances that have this combo going on in the background (think Kilian's Taste of Heaven or Lalique's Pour Homme) and this will begin to show the vanilla, musk and lavender in different forms than you could differentiate previously, and this will start to make PuHdC understandable and beautiful. The second thing that will happen is you will spray more than one spray and start to see that indolic quality that lavender can have, and eventually you might even meet that vanilla all by itself.The lavender is a strong and brilliant lavender that benefits from its dual processes of extraction which give the lavender a 3d-feel to it - one that lacks any sweetness of its own. If sprayed more than once, you will experience this herbal lavender for some time before getting the full 'dough' effect of it mingling with the vanilla. Once this fades, the vanilla will stand on its own, as a skin-scented, mildly sweet vanilla that doesn't suffer from the synthetic mass-produced vanilla note that we are all most likely tired from at this point. Overall, I appreciate this combo as an addition to other fragrances. It seems like a chord progression, which, while pleasant, needs more going to make the song worth listening to in full. Nevertheless, it is a brilliant composition all the while which helps the nose in a great deal when it comes to fragrances that orient themselves towards this iconic quality.8/10YT: Jess AndWesH Oct 01 2016\",\n",
       " 'smellavision': \"Vanilla and lavender bomb! Very straightforward and rounded. Not especially masculine, but rather unisex in my opinion. Opening with pure lavender, which is - finally - caught up by the vanilla after one-two hours depending on weather and skin conditions.I like lavender, tonka and sage but I miss a little more freshness here. Ofcourse, being released in 1934 it will smell differently than most releases today - funny thing is that a lot of sweeter male fragrances have been released for the last ten years - repeating the cycle maybe ??Although there are 30 years in between, I can also see some similarities between this and Guerlain's Habit Rouge, with the later being much heavier on the lemon and rose (which is also present in this but not listed).

As the lavender begins to die down, vanilla waltzes in and this is where the magic begins.... the remaining dry down of the lavender marries perfectly with the vanilla forming a beautiful lavender vanilla aura combo that smells like a fresh airy country breeze! I love this part particularly... simply fantastic! But it comes at a price..... the initial atom bomb of lavender takes too long to die down.... you have to suffer a good hour or two before it gets full into the magical part of lavender/vanilla heaven. If you're going out, you have to time yourself by spraying it on beforehand... otherwise, air-raid sirens might be set off when you're out in public. :) Sep 02 2016\",\n",

Both scents have lavender and vanilla, but they have a totally different feel to them. Caron starts off with an almost medicinal lavender (which I love!) and a bit of vanilla, then goes musky and powdery almost before it's even finished drying. I know it's probably my skin chemistry turning this to powder, which is unfortunate because I really like the way it smells in the vial. Even so, I think it has very little in common with Taste of Heaven, which is more syrupy and leaning towards Oriental, with no musk. Aug 02 2016\",\n",

Caron Pour Un Homme could only disappoint form there - but after one spray, it became obvious this scent could never disappoint.The opening is an intensely heavy, woody lavender. It's almost too much, but fortunately the lavender mellows quickly as the vanilla also comes to the fore. Both notes mingle together gloriously, with neither dominating as the scent dries down. The notes also grow sweeter as the scent settles on the skin. Musk is also present, but it plays a stealthy role, bolstering and rounding out the dominant notes like an unseen stagehand - its artistry is apparent in the way it perfectly frames the stars, while remaining out of the spotlight.The pastel-green juice gives the impression that Caron is a fresh, perhaps even green, aromatic summer scent. However, it is actually more of an oriental, with a sweet creaminess that makes it better suited to spring and autumn. That said, it is very versatile - you could wear this casually or with a suit. It's also quite unisex, in the same way Shalimar is a unisex scent. After the intense lavender opening, this would be a great women's fragrance. Overall, it's a classy blend that doesn't feel dated and is easy to wear. Jun 09 2016\",\n",

I was confused as I had wrongly assumed that a green-coloured scent would smell fresh, green or citrusy. I wore it on a hot day and didn't appreciate its cosy and warming effect. Instead I was greeted with a complex musky and aromatic oriental, which fuses vanilla and lavender in an almost otherworldly, perhaps even alien blend. 2 years later and with more experience of the world of perfumery under my belt, I am astonished by the beauty of Pour un Homme. Now, it evokes memories of other perfumes that I love; perfumes with a fine Parisian pedigree, such as Shalimar.  I now define it as a cooler weather fragrance and am currently lying on my bed, loving the blanket of luxury that PuH provides. This is a true 20th century classic. May 07 2016\",\n",

The first 5 to 10 minutes make you go 'what did I just spray on me' while hoping that your girlfriend remains 10 more minutes in the shower before she hugs and greets you with a kiss.  It' true, the first 5 minutes or 10 minutes are not that great. Tolerable,sure, great? Not at all.Luckily the next phase is a true transformation to greatness. Every single time I'm baffled how this Lavender evolves to a gorgeous and masculine vanilla/musk base that is just mouthwatering and comforting. The difference with the opening couldn't be bigger. The base lives for quite a while but does it in a soft and silent way. You will often catch whiffs of this delicious scent but overall the projection is @ arms length and the scent trail is soft. In a way it's a more an ethereal thing that lingers in the air rather than a perfume you drag behind you. This fragrance shines when your loved ones are cuddling up in your arms or when people hug you. It's an honest fragrance, it's a romantic fragrance and under the right circumstances it's even a little bit sexy. On top of that it does all of that while still preserving masculinity. Yeah, maybe not in the macho way of masculinity but in the kind of masculinity that makes a man a man because he believes in honest values and knows what he wants.Amazing that this fragrance is so old. Don't let anyone fool you this is dated. It's remarkable wearable in 2016 and I suspect it will be remarkable wearable in 2056 as well. Time is a concept and age is in your mind.Ethereal classic.

I used a mini bottle to scent my scarf and it was a pleasing experience, especially when wearing some old school more elaborated fougeres or eaux de cologne !

       " 'Germany': \"Indeed a very beautiful lavender vanilla fragrance. Starts  of quite masculine and shortly becomes completely unisex. I love it. It does smell somewhat like taste of heaven but less intense , less dark,less sweet and less deep and less warm. A lot more linear and watery , It's like taste but stripped of the heavy warm fuzzy deep aspect. The patchouli and Amber and tonka are missing to make this more rounded and longer lasting. It fleets rather quickly but it's enjoyable while it lasts. It's a nice one  to have, but I definitely prefer taste of heaven , this might be better in the hot weather during the day and then at night switch to Taste of heaven. If taste of heaven is a woollen blanket then Caron is a linen sheet. Or in other words , taste would be a more formal or date night sexy scent and Caron a more during the day casual fresh scent.

Three different instruments playing well together and keeping it natural and fresh, but as in a field under the sun not out of the shower or dryer. Think this could be used by women. It has zero of a men fume harshness. That lavender sharpness is softened quickly. A modern male may not find this trendy enough. An older gentleman may find this quite appealing.

This would be great on the man, if the lady wore Shalimar  as the two would harmonize very well I think.  This is quite soft and one can only smell it quite closely so that is a very good plus.

Basically the illustrious Pour Un Homme de Caron is defined from three notes, which are them, Lavender, the vanilla and musk, and here we already realize that your olfactory path, its evolution, will not be anything, because of these three notes being practically a \"masterpiece\" for the fragrance when they appear in the olfactory pyramid of a fragrance. Its opening is a horse dose of Lavender, that reminds us to the interior smell of barber shop, where the man smell of amalgam to the smell of products for the care of the man, who for the most part, they carry the same aromatic content of Lavender this fragrance brings in its opening. After a 4 h with the power of antiseptic aromatic content that Lavender has to transmit in perfumery, Pour Un Homme de Caron reverberates a fantastic presence for the emergence of vanilla, remembering that it is not a gourmand vanilla, as the classic here came from 30\\'s decade, but a vanilla earthy, masculine, which in a step to daydream comes to exhale pure testosterone, something kind of close to the rubberized transcending the figure of a clean man besides using beard when he speaks his voice is more serious than the normal. Finally, I may be crazy, but in addition to a super Musk \"pissed off\" that the fragrance rescende considerably, also realize some dry roses nuances and a burning handful of cedar wood, giving it a federal flavored to close this classic with Key gold studded with diamonds never seen before.

The vanilla, melded with a dab of civet into a powdery musk, is entirely inedible, cool, silky in feel, and truly powerful.

If you have scoured the fragrance universe in search of a signature that doesn't require mind-bending analysis to enjoy, and have not yet touched on the venerable house of Caron, do try Pour un Homme.

I was turned on to it because my favorite shaving soap artisan had recreated the original Mousse de Saxe base that Caron had used for so many of their fragrances.  He used it to make a shaving soap that was as close in scent to the original Pour un Homme de Caron as it could be, and from the first time I lathered that soap up I was hooked.  I immediately purchased PuHdC and am still in love with it.  Regardless of the fact that the version I own is not the same as the vintage versions that did contain the wonderful Mousse de Saxe base, it is still a fantastic fragrance.  It starts out with a sharp, wet blast of herbal lavender, and in about 15 minutes calms down and rounds out to smooth lavender, sweet vanilla, and a touch of clean musk; that\\'s it.  Elegant, simple, and genius (in my humble opinion).  It is miles away from what the standard \"men\\'s\" fragrances of today smell like, but it is still incredibly relevant.  A lot of newer fragrances seem to be an all-out assault on the olfactory system of everyone around; I don\\'t know if that\\'s the way they are created, or if its because the droves of young folks who all douse themselves with the same fragrance.  In a world where this \"assault\" is the norm, Caron Pour un Homme is a true breath of fresh air, in its understated simplicity.

Lavender is a lovely soothing smell and I have to say that this is one of the most natural lavenders I've smelled. Maybe I should cut it some slack as it's been around since the 30's but I don't get it? The vanilla and musk are gentle basenotes which for my tastes just make a boring and unimaginative backdrop for the potency of lavender.My examples being... yes this is similar to Taste of heaven but at least that has a little more interest in other notes like absinthe and prominent vanilla. Or Eau de L'occitane which again has that super realistic lavender but also has a woody, peppery, hardness to dirty up the lavender a bit.I would never wear a fragrance so linear and even the beauty of lavender can become annoying and headache inducing after a while.Sorry but this is yet another classic I can't abide.

       " 'Aschecte': \"Sometimes less is just more ! Pure Lavender for a total of 10-20 seconds tops. The lavender quickly fades along with a very synthetic, and indescribable to my nose scent. In comes a unique vanilla note that over the course of an hour develops into one of the most warm and inviting vanilla scents I have encountered. That to some may not be saying much, but I really like how it grows from a straight vanilla to a deep and almost Gourmand Vanilla that just makes you feel good (think comfort food). There is also more to this than the musk note in the base as well though as I said earlier I just can't describe it.... I can only guess as this scent has been around since 1934 and uses the base of Mousse de Saxe that these unique vanilla/leather/musk scents stem from this iconic compound. The lavender is so fleeting I really don't consider this a lavender scent except as I said for about 20 seconds before it evolves. Great scent at a very affordable price point though will not be for everyone. Dec 17 2014\",\n",

I think it\\'s so soothing and cool and aromatic and calming... and if you are like me, then this thing is Lavender Heaven in a Bottle!Pour Un Homme de Caron is a wonderful fragrance for any man and any gentleman out there! Even though it was released 80 years ago, it doesn\\'t smell dated! It smells classic and refined! It\\'s basically a Lavender and Vanilla combination, with Musk in the base, and this is the same Lavender Vanilla which came from Guerlain - Jicky, and which continued until Jean-Paul Gaultier\\'s Le Male and Dior\\'s Eau Noire etc... However this is the daddy of them all! This is a classic fragrance which has a dominant, smooth, herbal Lavender note, surrounded by Sage, Rosemary, Moss, Tonka, Amber and Vanilla. The opening is bright with Lemon and Bergamot, and the heart has Rose, Rosewood and Cedarwood. What I love about it, is that it strikes a fine balance between herbal, smooth, and sweet... and in no way is it ever cloying or offensive, it\\'s just beautifully and masterfully done!To me, this is classic French sophistication in a bottle. Any man could wear this, at any time, at any place. It has no boundaries. The only requirement is that you love Lavender (with a little sweetness attached). I really can\\'t see how anyone would not like this. For me, I love it! It makes me happy just to smell it anytime of day. Beautiful, beautiful stuff.

If you dont like sweet, powdery perfumes,or are only into aquatic/fresh/fruity frags, walk away. If you have notions of dated/old man/your prejudice here, run away and dont look back! You're still here? Good. Welcome to one of the best lavender vanilla combos ever blended. I could go on and on but essentially that is what Pour un Homme is and that is pretty much all that it is. It starts off a little herbal and has a green, unlit cigarette  tobacco like  note in the begining. I have no idea what it is since tobacco is not listed but after that it settles down into a very comfortable, slightly sweet and powdery,lavender and vanilla blend. It stays pretty much that way until some musk creeps in during the dry down. projection is restrained and longevity is a good 5-6 hours on me and my clothes smell of it the next day. A very relaxing, sweet powdery frag, kind of dandified, from the time when men knew they were men and did not need woody notes in their frags to proclaim it so! Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, etc etc. Pour un Homme is not a frag that plays by modern rules but it's been in production since 1934 so obviously there is a market for it and with good reason. This is the reference lavender in a masculine as far as I am concerned. Might not be for everyone but if you like lavender or vanilla, this should be in your collection without question. I love it.

       " 'Redbeard': 'I\\'m approaching this again with some trepidation, me not being a fan of lavender or powdery notes, and merely tolerating vanilla. Fortunately the opening lavender is already toned down enough (with powder!?) to not bother me with that sweatiness that it sometimes has, though it gets slightly worse before it gets better. However they\\'ve done it, what would normally come across as stinky armpit BO for me, becomes this strange, hollow, crisp planty aura, like a clear distillate of Christmas wreaths mixed with the sharp herbs of Yatagan. Until this point, the powder had faded away and was only detectable if I wiped the residue from the tip of my nose after sniffing. Finally, during the last gasps of the lavender, the powder is back with more vanilla. All that remains after a while is a clean, powdery vanilla, which could be perfectly unisex. It\\'s quite surprisingly light and airy, considering how many times I feel like I\\'ve been choked to death by vanilla or powder.One reviewer (MHV) noted below that CPUH is not a fragrance so much as a scent, which just \"is\", from the familiar scene of a man dilligently going about his routine, shaving and showering before work. In that role, I find this stuff much more believable than Rive Gauche, probably because it\\'s not an exact replica of one product\\'s scent (i.e. Barbasol coypcat). I agree that it\\'s very conservative, but as is sometimes the case, it\\'s so conservative, and from such a different time, that it\\'s almost anachronistic. While I\\'m not a fan of all the latest releases, this follows norms that are just so different from what we\\'d expect today, that I\\'m not sure I\\'d find it very practical over the long term. I should have used it many, many more times before writing this. It might make a really classy room spray though, and since they\\'ve done such a good job of making a fragrance that I sort of like out of notes that I normally don\\'t, I\\'ll give it a thumbs up.

       " 'Karenin': 'I´ve turned my nose to “Pour Un Homme de Caron” because it´s a classic masculine fragrance which, in spite of (no doubt) numerous reformulations, has stood the test of time, moving effortlessly across the decades and into the future. When it comes to its composition, “Pour Un Homme de Caron” is a straightforward fragrance. The two notes in the limelight here are lavender and vanilla. I detect a soft musky background in the base as well. The scent is light and unobtrusive, yet it has a pretty decent longevity. The lack of complexity legitimately attracts some criticism. I myself, for instance, prefer more full-bodied perfumes in the colder months of the year. But let´s face it. Aren´t there times when many of us find comfort in unpretentious, well-composed perfumes? As far as this function is concerned, “Pour Un Homme de Caron” does wonders.While there are heaps of fragrances that are claimed to be “timeless”, “Pour Un Homme de Caron” rightfully deserves this attribute. Not tied to any particular period, it still oozes refinement and natural elegance, and can be worn with a smart suit as well as a T-shirt and jeans. In my view, it works perfectly on a crisp spring or early summer morning, making the already fine day just a little bit more special... Happy 80th birthday, “Pour Un Homme de Caron”!

Not too musky, not too vanilla, and just enough lavender. Elegant simplicity. Leaves you feeling fresh/clean. Longevity is somewhat short as this is more of a skin scent than a cologne/EdT, but moisturize first and layer... and you\\'ll get a good 8 hours--just enough for the day. Or, carry a small spray bottle with you. And yes, sillage is rather close.

When I wear any of the fragrances in my wardrobe, I put on a persona,a life, a theme, making that day a little more interesting than what it would have normally been.Caron Pour Un Homme does this for me to the max.It just so happends that when I first became aquainted with PUH, my wife was really into the \"Downton Abbey\" series (And still is). As I watched the Episodes with her and met all the different characters I couldnt help but think \"What would it smell like in that house?/ What whould they smell like?\" Really enjoying the characters of Lord Grantham and Mathew Crawley, I wanted to find the scent that would fit them perfectly.Looking into my fragrance collection I found a good group of fragrance that could fit the bill.(Nothing from that time period but fits the theme)Polo Green Eau SauvageSafari4711Guerlains Vetiverect......Though they are great fragrances and do fit the bill for me, they weren\\'t the perfect fragrances. Until I looked in a small corner of my cabinet and saw three samples of PUH.I, like many, was put off by the opening notes of Lavender. Felt really old (PUH is far from old, it just felt like it at the time). But I wasn\\'t mature enough in fragrances to really appreciate it for what it was when I first ordered it. In a few adjectives I\\'d describe it as:Noble EdwardianElegantHigh ClassSimple (Humble)Vanilla and LavenderNow, wearing it and watching downton abbey completely adds to the experience of the smell.  And that is why I love fragrance. Everytime I put this beautiful fragrance on (In my mind) I become a high class englishman with an estate like that of downton abbey or biltmore (in North Carolina). It raises the spirit and puts a little nobilty in your step. (I know.... Im crazy right)I know I havent described the fragrance in detailed notes, but anybody can say vanilla,lavender, and musk.

C'est le parfum de l'homme d'action ayant confiance en lui : une présence que l'on remarque sans être intrusif et pas seulement à cause de son parfum.Longévité 1.5/2 et évolution 4/4. Son évolution est remarquable puisque la lavande tonique cède le pas à une vanille musquée chaleureuse. Toute réapplication est un bonheur pour faire revivre ce jeu entre tonicité et chaleur et faire revivre un brin de soirée estivale et provençale en tout lieu et en toute saison ! Le tout petit défaut étant qu'on aimerait qu'il tienne un tout petit peu plus que 3 heures, peut-être - mais c'est un parfum vraiment pour la journée.Total 19.5/20 Chef d'oeuvre. Sep 08 2013\",\n",
       " 'missk': \"Pour Un Homme de Caron is such a modern scent, not unlike Jean Paul Gaultier's Le Male. It's that sweet, vanillary lavender that has me in a trance.If I had my way, all men would own at least one lavender scent. I just love the way this note smells on a man's skin. With that being said, I love the way it smells on me too. I'm half inclined to buy myself a bottle of Pour Un Homme de Caron. Why should guys have all the fun?I realise that some men may be turned off by the sweetness of this fragrance, even the somewhat powdery, musky base may act as a deterrent. That's understandable. Caron Yatagan is so rugged and manly when compared to Pour Un Homme de Caron, they're complete opposites.Pour Un Homme de Caron is an incredibly soothing scent, perfect for the warmer weather. I think the scent is unique enough to turn a few heads, and is even something that could interest the ladies. Take note boys.I know a few women who wear and own Pour Un Homme de Caron, and honestly I will more than likely be joining them. This scent is too good to pass up. It's a must for all lavender fans. Although Caron is considered niche, it's not a house with outrageous price tags. Pour Un Homme de Caron is very affordable, especially for something of such high quality. Sep 02 2013\",\n",
       " 'CaughtJester': \"Caron Pour Un Homme is  elegant, sophisiticated and refined in its simplicity. Lavender and vanilla fade gradually into musk, exuding maturity and warmth.The Story:Pour Un Homme greets you with a warm bear hug, stepping in out of the chill of winter. The aromatic lavender exudes spice, sweetened and softened by the vanilla. He is undeniably masculine, generous of spirit and good with kids. He has a labrador at home, goes for a run in the misty winter mornings and truly loves his wife. Pour Un Homme reads classic fiction, asks himself the big questions, and isn't afraid of the answers.The simple structure of this cologne does not make it boring. Far from it, it makes it honest, trustworthy. This is a grown man's cologne. A man in his 20's could wear it, but only if he was mature. A teenager would seem ridiculous, like a child in his dad's suit, wearing something as sophisticated as this.Longevity is better in cold weather for this, lasting 5-6 hours, and projection is about arm's length after the first hour. Put simply: I love it. It's unpretentious, elegant and honest. If you can pull it off, there is no danger of seeming like you're trying too hard. It exudes warmth and maturity. Aug 25 2013\",\n",

Pour un Homme is basically vanilla & lavender, but not girly, and not that soapy lavender smell (yuk). I have gotten that Play-Doh comparison (I don't get it myself) by one woman, but she still loved it.It's understated. It speaks, doesn't shout. It doesn't precede you into a room and it doesn't linger in the elevator after you've gotten out. You have to have somebody get right up next to you to smell it, which is pretty much why I wear a fragrance. There is nothing else like it = Nothing. Else. Like. It. One of the quintessential scents of France--what French guys actually wear. Truly classic, not trendy. Probably better for a professional guy in his 40's, not a club kid in his 20's.

First the old 100ml bottle you won't even give  a second look and years later I stumbled upon the updated 125ml bottle like the one in the poster. Very conservative, stays very close to you, highly respectable scent. what you lose in projection you gain in wearability and you also get a unique intellectual feel. It opens with strong lavender and citrus notes, the progression is gradual and eventually you get that fresh soft musk at the end that lasts and lasts.

It's the simplest perfume that I've ever tested. Just three note exist in this one. As others wrote here it start with lavender, next it goes to sweet vanilla and at the end it dries down to musk. The only thing that stops me to use it is that it reminds me of my childhood. When I was around eight years old I remember that all the soaps and other bath shampoos had exactly the same lavender note. Everyone was smelling like this after taking bath in the past. The projection is acceptable and it's around 2 to 3 hours. sillage is moderate and longevity is good on my skin (around 5-6 hours).I think it's suitable for men over 40.این عطر خیلی قدیمیه و شاید پدر یا پدربزرگ هاتون ازش استفاده می کردن. در موردش تو کتاب لوکا تورین خوندم و اونجا هم بهش نمره 5 از 5 داده بود. دنبالش بودم تستش کنم.بوی قشنگی داره ولی خیلی خیلی سبکش قدیمیه. یکی از ساده ترین عطرهایی هست که تا حالا تست کردم. کلا سه تا نت داخلش هست. اول با اسطوخودوس شروع میشه و که بودی ملایمی داره بعد از مدتی اسطوخودوس خیلی ضعیف میشه و بوی وانیل شروع میشه و بعد از بوی وانیل هم میره سراغ مشک. همین !!تنها چیزی که اجازه نمیده ازش استفاده کنم اینه که منو یاد بچگی هام می ندازه. اگر متولد دهه پنجاه یا شصت باشید قطعا حمام عمومی رو یادتون میاد. بچه که بودم وقتی حمام عمومی می رفتم همین بو اونجا استشمام میشد. البته بوی خود حمام این نبود. همه صابون ها و شامپوها این سبک بو رو داشتند. بوی صابون گلنار هم نمیده. بوی اون صابون سفیدهایی رو میده که شبیه به استخون بود :))) ولی در کل همه بعد از استحام و خروج از حمام بوی مشابه با این داشتند. برای همین اگر استفاده کنید و ملت بهتون گفتن تازه از حموم اومدی بیرون تعجب نکنید.پخش بوش حدود دو سه ساعت هست و بعد از اون بو ضعیف و نزدیک به پوست میشه. روی پوست من هم تا پنج شش ساعتی می مونه. فکر میکنم بیشتر به درد آدم های بالای 40 سال و بابا بزرگ ها بخوره تا جوان های حال حاضر Aug 08 2013\",\n",

It is big and bold as expected but the lavender note smells weird to me. I like lavender, especially as the sharp floral top note moderates, and I own a few lavender oils and a lavender absolute (my favorite). Caron Pour un Homme doesn't smell much like them - it seems to have exaggerated the sharp floral part of lavender and added something tartly citric and sweet. The combination is unpleasant to me.

I wear the vintage version with the black plastic cap (1960s?), which is more herbal than the current vintage. Clary sage top notes that burn off quickly to lavender and eventually to vanilla, remaining smooth and creamy throughout. This is a very gentle fragrance that makes me feel clean and happy, and it lasts for hours. It goes with food, it goes in the open air or in the house. It never gets above its station, it's just a lovely fragrance. Why it's a masculine is beyond me, I must say - it's softer than Habanita, for instance. I've tried this on one wrist with Gris Clair on the other and they couldn't be more different. Gris Clair is addictive but far more of a challenge with its smoky toilet-cleaner topnotes, while the Caron is far better behaved and as comfy as a worn-in pair of beige suede shoes. Yummy.

       " 'Bigsly': 'I agree with those who say things like this smells like burnt plastic, but only for the recent formulation.  I have the Les Plus Belles Lavandes EdT version (the liquid is lightly tinted with a dull green), which I don\\'t think was produced beyond the 1960s.  I tried the new one several times over the course of the last four years but hated it every time (seemed way too \"synthetic), but I decided to give the vintage formulation a chance based upon my experiences with these old formulations.As in just about all other cases, the vintage version is great.  It is quite simple, like the new version, but the \"complexity\" comes from the ingredient quality in this case.  The lavender is crisp and clear, and while it does have a bit of that burnt quality that one can find with lavender notes, this is light and natural, making it more compelling.  The vanilla also smells great, and over time it becomes more prominent while the lavender becomes less prominent.  Eventually, they sort of \"meet in the middle.\"  There\\'s also a bit of an animalic quality but it\\'s smoother than in the new version.As an aside, anyone who thinks that Caron would sell something with the quality of the vintage version I have at their current prices doesn\\'t understand the costs involved (this is based upon industry people I\\'ve spoken to) so keep that in mind when you see a \"great deal\" on a reformulated classic.  I can swap up to half ounce decants of my vintage version for those who are really interested in it.  It\\'s fairly strong for a few hours and then becomes a skin scent.  Also over time it takes on a bit of a powdery quality.My old review (which was of the new version): This is another one I tried to like over a period of years now, yet I always have come to the same conclusions. After top notes that I don\\'t like at all (not \"natural\" smelling to me), the vanilla and lavender come together as a \"blob\" that is irritating (I\\'m guessing due to ingredient quality). Later on, there is an animalic aspect, and then later a floral/woody one I perceive as clearly \"synthetic.\" I wonder if higher-quality ingredients would make a difference here, or it may be that it\\'s just too simple for me. And on top of this, I think of women\\'s fragrances when I smell this, even though I wear a bunch of women\\'s fragrances myself (they don\\'t strike me as especially \"feminine\"). This is \"old school\" too, so if you don\\'t like those kinds of fragrances I don\\'t see a need to sample this one. By contrast, I\\'d much rather wear Roadster, which replaces the lavender with mint and has a few more notes that are clear. It\\'s also more \"natural\" smelling to me, and not \"old\" (and certainly not \"feminine\" smelling either). Third Man is more interesting (with no \"off\" notes) to me, though it\\'s also rather simple, so I suggest sampling that one before CPUH if you want to sample Caron\\'s men\\'s fragrances and want something in the sweet/floral area. If you have skin chemistry that really \"eats up\" a fragrance, perhaps this can work for you, but for me, a fragrance can\\'t get much more cloying than this! Oct 05 2012',\n",

       " 'anomie et ivoire': 'For the pre-recent-reformulaton edt (~90s?): The older version of Pour Un Homme de Caron is the fragrance I wear and enjoy most often and to most reliable satisfaction. It lends itself to lavish spritzes on linens before sleep, a spray on a scarf for comfort\\'s sake before travel, or splashing on generously after a shower to transition from cleanliness to stimulation. I go through about .25 oz/week gladly, as even in vintage this is very affordable. The only reasons I prefer the vintage are: superior lasting power and a more pleasing lavender. Otherwise the current formula is quite comparable, if not in abstractly felt-for \"quality,\" then in its basic smell and impression.This Caron lasts most of the day if sprayed 2-3 times but is more enjoyable if refreshed every few hours. The sillage is noticeable but soft and alluring, not demanding or try-hard. Pour Un Homme, Femme, both, neither: wear it to experience lavender as a natural magic: of sparkling solidity and shifting light; a geode. Tonka-vanilla and musk are allowed each their own space and freedom to become colors, textures, feelings, ever-sharpened ideas instead of the white noise they\\'re reduced to in most other scents. A doughy-rich amber shows up frequently on repeat wearings while a camphorous mint makes a very occasional appearance before drydown. Cold/warm contrasts edge out too much focus on sweetness, though the ice cream feeling mentioned in other reviews is evident just before the warmer drydown.This is the meaning of the word elegance: simplicity, though not simple. Pour Un Homme is perfume\\'s answer to Ezra Pound\\'s \"In A Station of the Metro\" in form, function, near-perfection while dismissing the need for perfection, in being so direct, so alive.

Amazing!This masterpiece is only to be avoided when one really hates lavender or vanilla.If not, this is a must buy!It is mainly a three note composition of lavender, vanilla and musk but so well blended that it is rightfully considered as a masterpiece!It opens with a fresh blast of lavender which smells very pure! Shortly after the raw vanilla (which is indeed not sweet) kicks in surrounded by musk which makes this frag pretty unique, very fresh and clean! During the base the vanilla and musk take over on the lavender but the moment this happens is difficult to point out! It's that well blended. the frag gives you a clean, fresh feeling and is perfect for casual wear during the morning in spring or summer after you showered! Longevity is average (6 hrs) and sillage is from  above average to average during the course of wearing time. An advantage is that this can be applied in different ways; over-apllication for huge sillage (at first) and decent longevity if one wants this for as long as possible or just a few sprays to start the first morning hours in a very fresh but warm way!

       " 'Buysblind': \"The note pyramid pretty much says it all. Lavender, Vanilla, and a little bit of Musk. Once it settles in, this is a really nice fragrance--very low key and calm with a relaxing appeal. And over time you may in fact come to enjoy the wild opening of sharp, piercing lavender which blasts your sinuses upon the initial spray. It's kind of a fun way to start off this scent which is otherwise friendly and well-mannered. Spray away, it's hard to over do it with this one. Versatile, Caron Pour un Homme can definitely be worn in casual situations or on more formal occassions, and in most types of weather save for really hot, humid days. It's an excellent alternative to A Taste of Heaven, and at less than $35 for 100 mls, it's a bargain.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a bottle. Jun 19 2012\",\n",

       " 'lovingthealien': \"One of my very most beloved fragrances. This really helps me unwind! It's not a terribly complex fragrance but the devil is in the details:It opens with a tremendously herbal and intoxicating natural lavender that's breathtaking. It begins to emanate more sensual notes under the lavender of cedar, vanilla, and musk. The interplay between all of the notes would be revolting if it wasn't so comforting. The whole effect is something akin to the smell of my grandmother's cedar linen cabinet, always stocked with Yardley English Lavender soap. It manages to remain handsome, and the vanilla/cedar/musk combo is to die for despite the ice cream comments here. Jun 15 2012\",\n",
       " 'SecondCherry': \"Speaking as a woman, the name is just daft - this is definitely a unisex fragrance. Today my vintage bottle (50ml, black top) arrived and it's substantially different from the modern splash mini I was using. The modern version is smoother and less complex; the vintage version seems more complicated, with a sharp lemony, rosemary, minty and strong lavender opening that is almost offputting at first. It takes some time to calm down into the same lavender/vanilla blend that I'm familiar with from the modern formulation. This is a really delicious fragrance that I wear a surprising amount  - warm and comforting for sleeping in, great for white linen days, times when you want to feel clean but not in a white floral way. I might give the DH my modern mini for travelling. Jun 06 2012\",\n",
       " 'oxm': 'Pour un Homme by Caron is a warm scent prevails as the bottom densely vanilla, the contrast is played face to face with notes of lavender, is much more of a classic (some say démodé) but still could return to the nostalgic desire to use them, reminiscent of the colonies of Alyssa Ashley musk that give the feeling of wellbeing that comes after a shower when puffs of talcum go to mitigate the efforts of a busy day.

       " 'jcastano': \"For about 3 years, I eyed this scent both in department stores and online vendors. I was always so hesitant to pull out my wallet and actually go through with purchasing a scent that was crafted in the 1930's but I desperately desired to try a fragrance from the Caron house. With that, I'm ecstatic that I added this classic to my collection! The fragrance itself has more than 3 notes, fragrantica missed a few, but overall, it's simple with what it presents and is beautifully executed in the process. I won't lie, the opening is almost revolting and when I first sprayed it on myself, I was instantly drawn away. To my nose, the earthy aspect in the opening blended with the citrus and spice, although appealing in theory, is overwhelmingly odd. The rosemary is too potent and the lemon is sharp while a soft lavender slowly makes a subtle arrival. Anyway, for about 15 minutes, I was shaking my head in disappointment when all the sudden, I sensed a delicate waft of vanilla and lavender that warped my olfactory cells entirely. It was something that reminded me of one of my all time favorites, Le Male by JPG. I sniffed around and couldn't find the source of this glorious aroma when I realized it was I! The scent became a whole different fragrance! The mid and base are a combination of sugared florals interwoven with rich cedar and rosewood. The marriage of both vanilla and lavender is pure with absolutely no distortion of any other notes overpowering the two.            They are exclusive and faithful to one another and their roles in Pour Un Homme illustrates just that. Think of a powdery vanilla ice cream cone threaded with fresh lavender. That's how this smells like to me. It ends with a white musk/tonka bean synthesis that attempts to divide the lovers but their fidelity remains far too enduring.As lovely as this is, it's not for everyone and definitely is difficult to pull off in the warmer months and casually at that. The elegance in the scent is quite superior to most mass market fragrances. It's also quite unisex so women needn't fret to test this magnificent juice. For some reason, I can't help but wonder if Jean Paul Gaultier was inspired by this Caron classic. All Le Male fans should at least give this fragrance a wearing to further identify with my statement. Top notch stuff! Apr 02 2012\",\n",

Es llamativo, como una fragancia construida mayoritariamente centrada en dos notas olfativas, lavanda y vainilla, pueda ser a la vez que simple compleja. Esta complejidad es debida a la frescura de la lavanda y la calidez de la vainilla, estas conforman un combo de sofisticación que da a Caron pour homme una fragancia de esas que tienen efecto-memoria. En mi humilde opinión, veo parecidos a otros perfumes como el ya citado Mouchoir de Monsieur y Jicky de Guerlain. Feb 20 2012',\n",
       " 'sherapop': \"Caron POUR UN HOMME is a loud lavender-vanilla cologne. You have to really love lavender to wear this one. Lavender-vanilla is not one of my most beloved combinations of notes, so perhaps it's not that surprising that POUR UN HOMME is not my favorite Caron--or even my favorite made-for-men Caron. Still, I find the lavender of this particular composition exceptionally harsh and grating upon application. There is a sharpness which I do not generally find in lavender perfumes such as Guerlain Aqua Allegoria LAVANDE VELOURS, which I sometimes use as a bedtime scent to induce sleep.POUR UN HOMME does mellow out after a bit, but to my nose, it's always fairly strident lavender sweetened with vanilla, from start to finish.A question: am I mistaken, or is that a man fondling a woman's breast in one of the ad photos above?!

So is Pour Un Homme de Caron.I need to be honest with you: I don\\'t feel the barbershop aspect that many claims to have (thank God!).In my perception, it opens exactly like the English Lavender (Yardley of London), with an excellent lavender that is both natural and striking, besides more manly and masculine. About five minutes later, a \"musky\" vanilla appears and it is this smell that remains on my skin, brilliantly, for the rest of the evolution.Many say: \"if you like vanilla, you will love this perfume!\". Well, I love vanilla, but I must say: never expect a typical vanilla scent (creamy) by wearing Pour Un Homme, because it is not like Rochas Lui, for example, which is one of the best vanilla I have ever felt in men\\'s perfumes. In this fragrance from Caron, you will find one calmer and slightly powdery vanilla, which is neither too sweet nor too strong. It\\'s elegant!!The only \"defect\" (if I can call it that), is that I think it could exude more. However, within its timeless elegance proposal, it is perfect and has excellent durability.

The result is somewhat powdery, a little uric, but mostly it just screams lavender and licorice.It also smells its age and I'm frankly surprised that people are still buying it. Even were it in line with today's aesthetics or retro in a good way, which it isn't, Pour un Homme de Caron still fails as a fragrance. It simply never blends, never becomes anything more than its few overstrong, discordant notes, which sit together like strangers on a bus.I like that Pour un Homme de Caron is still available from a historical perspective.

The whole scent has a sought of faded photograph feel - as if the colours have become slightly desaturated and the high contrasts are greyed out. I really like it.Caron Pour un Homme was conceived in an age with a totally different aesthetic. It's so incredibly far removed from today's army of Young Turks and their omnipresent, high-pitched, screechy aqua potions.

It\\'s pretty romantic to think of all the decades this fragrance outlived - definitely timeless.On paper, Pour Un Homme is the truest lavender I\\'ve EVER smelled. It isn\\'t the soothing lavender that would put you to sleep (like on Covet), though. This lavender is sharply aromatic and invigorating and STRONG. It settles down after a few minutes, and thank you rafaeleleniz for identifying the rosemary! It\\'s definitely there. The strong herbs straddle fresh and medicinal in an abstract modern personality. An hour in, the vanilla becomes detectable. Wait another hour and the vanilla takes the lead. The combination of vanilla and lavender is divine. I much prefer this vanilla to the candy-sweets in gourmand scents.I don\\'t understand why Pour Un Homme isn\\'t unisex - the strong opening is very masculine, but the sweet drydown wouldn\\'t be unpleasant on a woman.Interestingly, the lavender that smells so good on paper does bizarre things on my skin. My skin makes the lavender smell sour, reminding me of the \"scented\" shampoo/soap provided by cheap motels. I don\\'t understand it, very frustrating! I paitiently bear it until after half an hour when the delicious vanilla comes in to redeem the herbal pungency of the opening.

The base shows a faint mossy scent that enhances and elevates the musk to extraordinary heights.

It's very sweet compared to my other more manly fragrances and definitely smells pretty unique, and as time goes on I think the sweet vanilla is dominant. but it's pretty comfortable to wear as long as you're ok with sweet fragrance, and you like vanilla, and you don't over apply it. I think it smells nicer if I don't over apply it. I like the fact that it comes from 1934, if it was a modern fragrance I'd probably like it a bit less.
