The perfume is announced as one full of contrasts and tensions.\\n\\nIts flacon is dark and powerful, as if it were announcing powerful ingredients it carries in itself. A veil of mystery and an explosive spicy accord reveal cardamom with sparkling freshness of bergamot, lavender and cedar, which stand for strength of men. Cumin and vetiver in a base ensure a sensual finish and an opulent, elegant closure.\\n\\nPerfume La Nuit de l`Homme is available in three sizes of bottle - 40ml edt, 60ml edt and100ml edt, along with perfumed deo spray in a collection. The noses behind this fragrance are Anne Flipo, Pierre Wargnye and Dominique Ropion.\\n '"

Pretty much most women will say it's a masterpiece. When I think sexy, sensual & intimate, I think of La Nuit. It's pure sex in a bottle. Women gravitate to this scent, I'm telling you... Now, for the disappointment. The reformulations killed the performance in my judgment, it's practically a skin scent with very little projection with the first little while (maybe an hour or more). So, the big question: Is it still worth it in 2020? My answer is it depends on you. On my skin & my hubby's, it's about a 2-hour fragrance if that, maybe slightly more & that's being super generous. The only realistic time I can see anybody wearing this now in 2020 is in intimate situations, that's pretty much it. It's way too soft for dates, clubbing, etc. I can't even smell it on him unless I'm literally burying my face into his neck basically. Take what you want from my personal experience, but that's the truth. I just don't want people to get disappointed when they buy it. In my humble opinion, there are better options out there you can pick from with better performance & projection... I find this one a bit outdated. YSL should really modernize this scent & re-release it with better performance because it would sell like hotcakes!NOTE: It's great, but I wouldn't pay top-dollar for a vintage batch unless you're like a hardcore fragrance lover/collector, it's just not worth it in my view.Scent: 9.5/10Price: 5.2/10Performance: 4/10Versatility: 7.8/10Compliment Factor: Low☐ Medium☐ High☐ Monstrous☑ (Only if she's close, otherwise I'd give it a medium)Ages: 25+My Recommendation: No, there are better options.

I wear it as a light lavender-cardamom aromatherapy type fragrance, and use it, and two others from this line, as linen sprays. (They have the airy, fresh simplicity of linen sprays.) The silage and projection are very poor, and the longevity is very short. Within 30 minutes it’s a skin scent; in 1 hour I have to huff my skin to smell it at all. Once you’ve smelled artisanal lavender frags, then YSL is a depressing reminder of how mass-commercial perfumery has (mostly) gone to shit (some are still good).

Please do not listen to the knuckleheads telling you to buy a bottle from 2010, the prime life of fragrances is three to five years, so why would you seek out a ten-year-old bottle, who's concentration would have weakened over the years, to about what the new fragrance is now?All fragrances need to be reformulated over time, certain ingredients will become unavailable, or the strength or concentration of essential oils and flowers change every season. if you love a 2010 Silver Oak cabernet wine, it does not mean you are going to like the 2018 version the same way, the grapes are different, even though the process of making it is the same, and that is true with fragrances over long periods of time as well, they ARE going to change, usually, they become weaker or more diluted. And that has happened to LNDH as many others have observed, it does not, however, take away from the unique originality of this fragrance.La Nuit De Homme is rich and creamy on the opening, you get bergamot and cedar. It becomes soft vetiver with powdery lavender on the dry down, which may sound feminine, but smells masculine without being overbearing. for me, everything blends together perfectly. Fragrance lovers should own and wear this for at least a season of their life to fully experience it.One of the greatest men's fragrances ever created. Apr 19 2020\",\n",

Some of these notes are found in scents like LNDL. I suggest if you’re experiencing olfactory fatigue, (you can’t smell your fragrance after 30-60 mins) then use scent free laundry detergent, stop using strong body wash, stop spraying air fresheners at home.

This YSL is one of the last ones I’d ever reach for. Oddly enough it truly smells like my dog’s veterinarian’s office, like either an industrial synthetic cleaner, or wet dog. Big pass for me. Oh and by the way, to the gentleman who left the review below, recommending that you wear this to a job interview if the interviewer is female... NO NO NO!!!! Horrible advice. NEVER EVER wear cologne or perfume to a job interview. Horrible advice. If someone wore this, I’d have them leave ASAP, since I dislike the smell. Pretty basic  stuff...

The scent is just completely linear, it doesn't develop or change in pretty much any way to my nose. It's a nice scent for sure, but I can give you a frag that I never hear anyone mention that has better performance, it's much, much cheaper and in my opinion is an all around better fragrance, especially in the dry down! It's Mont Blanc Emblem Absolute. It opens up with the same cardamom note but paired with pear and a fruit accord that really adds to the opening. The transition to the dry down takes 3 hours minimum, and it doesn't become a skin scent until your 8-10 hours in. It's an often overlooked and amazing option that should definitely be getting more notoriety if people so love this cardamom note. Jan 16 2020\",\n",

When I first smelled this I was a little disappointed. Smelled really good but performance was not good. However I did some research and learned about the different batches. I bought 2 bottles, a 2010 and 2011 batch. This is where I learned that the prime of this fragrance was 2009-2010. The reason this is a master piece is because of those batches. It smells better, projects a lot more and lasts 12+ hours. The 2011 batch is also amazing but that's where the decline began. It smells more fresh and weaker, but still performs better than the newer batches. From my experience 2010(GOAT tier)> 2011(Still Amazing)> everything after(Good).

However I must talk about reformulations. I am lucky enough to own all three formulations of this fragrance (2011,2014,2018) and id say the best way to describe them is that the \\'Vintage\" is overhyped and the Latest batch is overhated. I get maybe 1-2 hours more MAX on the vintage bottle compared to 2018 and the scent is really only more \\'boozy\\' in the first 10 minutes of the vintage. The difference is small and the vintage is in no way worth the mark up people pay for it. If you like this scent just buy the newer batches, its not worth the money. If you find a vintage, YAY now your gonna be anxious to use it all up...like me...La Nuit De L\\'homme was never a BEAST MODE fragrance, and the newer formulation while unfortunate, don\\'t ruin the fragrance.

Both have the same projection but the current reformulation wins out in longevity (although it's not a big difference). Current reformulation is still 100% worth it, and is good for anyone wanting to get a start on the DNA.

Warm spicy/aromatic, creamy, smooth and a compliment monster. Almost every person I approach says how good it smells. Has great longevity (8-10 hours) and good sillage, as it dries down it gets closer to the skin but's still noticeable by people around you. Juice is darker than current formulas.I have smelled more recent formulations (2014, ,2018 and 2019 batches) and no one comes close to what it was from 2009 to 2012. They're watered down, more powdery and not as warm as the original, and performance is awful. Its a shame YSL reformulated this masterpiece. Still, I'll be enjoying it as long as my bottle lasts.

Projection is also weak, I actually forgot I was wearing 2 sprays today as I hadn't caught a whiff since initially spraying it. It is largely pointless wearing it.

That's the only time it will really last 7+ hours for me, otherwise it's like 2-3 hours in other weathers/seasons. Sillage isn't all too great either as I mentioned; it's very subtle that someone would have to be sitting directly next to you to smell it. Overspraying would be good in this case if you really want the scent to project.Hype is real though, performance and sillage isn't.

In his videos, he indicated that it was one of his favourite scents for dates prior its re-formulation.In the scent itself, La Nuit de l\\'Homme starts with a beautiful, light but dense cardamom, providing a calm and soothing tea ambiance to the fragrance. After a few minutes, the powdery lavender creeps up to the top almost instantly, bridging a cedar base with the top notes that lasts about 6 hours on my skin. I can\\'t help but to notice that La Nuit de l\\'Homme can be categorized as a modern barbershop fougere due to its talcum powder characteristics. My sample is from a current batch, and I read somewhere that the newer batches have increased the lavender smell while subduing the cardamom. Either way, the fragrance is comforting, relaxing, and peaceful. More of a \"stress-reliever\" than a seducing/sexy scent to me, I would describe it as a luxury spa in a bottle.Like.

This perfume will instantly boost your sex appeal without the strong punch (Ex. Dior Sauvage). I love how subtle yet so attractive this scent is.

Sometimes it reminds me of Versace Eros minus the mint note and the effervescence combo of geranium, oakmoss, and ambroxan. Instead you get a semi-sweet cardamom that leads to a delicious and creamy drydown of vetiver and cumin. But we are living in an imperfect world as this scent suffers in its performance and longevity. Still, one of the best scents for all occasions in my opinion.8.2/10 Oct 10 2019',\n",

While I could smell wafts of the 2013 bottle even after 4-5hrs, I could barely smell anything on my 2016-current formulation bottles of the same perfume after 30mins of spraying.In all honesty, if you're not willing to dish out $200-300+ for a <100mL on older vintage bottles, you're probably better off looking for better fragrances because this one died in 2016.

The new one is softer and slightly sweeter, with a bit more emphasis on the lavender, and dries down to a diluted soapy scent.

I’m not the best at picking out various notes, and fairly new at exploring the huge varieties of scents out there, but La Nuit is absolutely incredible. It’s deep, DARK, and spicy... yet sweet, almost purely edible. A beautiful, warm, floral spiciness penetrates deep with this one, it smalls seductive, alluring, almost forbidden, as if derived from the gods. It smells slightly familiar, yet captivating and unique, a blend of exotic woods, spices, flowers, all brewed together and presented to you by a mythical creature of the forest, daring you to try it. It smells exotic yet natural, almost like some sort of undiscovered psychoactive substance, as strange as that sounds. I get hints of cinnamon, something edible, yet not fleeting/cloying. This fragrance is incredibly put together, and is possibly the greatest example of artistry in a perfume that I’ve come across so far. Absolutely divine, I have absolutely NOTHING bad to say about it. Some have complained about longevity, and I have no idea what they’re talking about as I sprayed it on my wrist a few hours ago and it has lost absolutely none of its potency, it’s only gotten deeper and more alluring.

It's Sweet, Spicy & Sexy with a hint of Dark. I think this is the perfect Date Scent. The Hype about this is real & I loved every bit of it (at least for the short while it lasted).Cons: Performance.On Skin - The reviews don't lie. The Performance is really bad. It does not project more than an arm's length. And that lasts about 30 minutes to 1 hour, then it's a skin scent. And that also lasts around 2 hours. So total 3 hours of scent until this fades to 10% and then disappears. On Clothes - Lasts about an hour more than on Skin, so make it 4 hours. I did not spray heavily though, just 2 sprays on the front to check it's performance. I get small whiffs of this after 4 hours but that's it.Verdict: It's a pass & only because of the performance, because I would rather wear a 7/10 scent which people can smell on me, rather than a 10/10 scent which even I can't smell after a few minutes.

Not really a bad smell but too sweet and almost fig like for my taste.Another reviewer liked it and he is from a cooler place so maybe it is better suited for places that aren't hot and humid.I might also describe it as smelling like an accord of ginger except with no spice at all and musky sweet.

As it dries down, I get a bit of a clean linen note, with the artificial floral that goes with it, but it's subtle.

The vintage batch code I got is 38KD01 (scent code from the box 8YB02-2) is produced in 2013 and is the 2011 scent formula.  This one is brighter and the performance is very good. I sprayed my vintage on my hand about 6pm and it projected well for good 2-3 hours. then becomes milder but still projects and next day when I woke up I could still smell the amazing dry down on my hand. The 2009-2011 scent formula (8YB02-1 scent code) is on par with 2012-2015 (8YB02-2 scent code), with the latter is brighter and fresher.This is a date scent, when you are getting closer to the girl.  Women love this scent. It’s a panty dropper. One of the best panty droppers out there. It goes beyond compliments and helps you get laid. Is it overhyped? The vintage is not because women love it and it helps you get laid. YSL killed the older formulation which sucks.

The test strips didn't totally do it justice, does a much better job on my skin.I know longevity seems to plague the current batch according to most reviewers but I seem to get 4-5 pretty good hours then another 3-5 of being a skin scent. Another knock I had heard is that it is feminine which to be honest I don't get, it is a soft and mildly powdery fragrance but by no means is it anything I would want to smell on a woman. Smells like a well put together man that has his shit together. I would recommend being at least low 20's or having a mature demeanor to rock this if you are under 25.In conclusion, it is well worth the $50 for me as a casual fragrance collector. I am not claiming it is the best fragrance ever but what I am saying is if you are a normal guy or someone with a small-medium collection and you want a nice fragrance that women will enjoy, you can't go wrong here even with the new formulation.

Yes, of course it\\'s sweet like any evening stuff and what did you expected? But for me it\\'s not that tipe of powerfull or enormous sweetness.It\\'s pleasant, it\\'s calm. It\\'s a refined sweetness. For me even Mugler\\'s A\\'Men is refined. It\\'s more sweet and I love it! Guerlain\\'s LIDGE is more sweet and I love it. That\\'s why comparing to them I think that La Nuit is not that sweet. It\\'s inoffencive, once again IMO.Does it deserve of all the hype around? I don\\'t know, I think - No. But is it good ? - Definitely! Moreover - it\\'s a very very good scent ! So if you like sweet stuff, you won\\'t regret buying this. BUT !Only buying the older formulation. Yes, the 2015 one is not a trainwreck if you didn\\'t try earlier ones. Scent is good, only longevity sucks. Especially sucks for who has a dry skin which doesn\\'t hold fragrances. I\\'m that one so the question of longevity is very important for me.People are saying that 2016 batch is even worse than 2015 So I do not recommend to buy them. Because there are other better options I guess. At least same D&G - The one EDP. It\\'s a very good scent, amazing, and girls also love it. And it\\'s nice in terms of money. But if you really wanna try \"La nuit\" I recommend you to search for 2012-2014 batches. Don\\'t pay insane amounts of money for earlier versions. Theyre better, It\\'s true. I\\'ve smelled original 2009 formulation, and I can say that it\\'s simply deeper. It has richer scent especially at the beginning, in opening (compared with my 2013 version). First 30 minutes you can clearly feel this difference, then both are same for about 1-1.5 hour and after that 2013 version goes like - \"volume\" down. So the 2009 version has like a +1 hour of good longevity on my skin. But I think it\\'s not worth of paying  three or four times more for 2009-2011 batches.If you want to try still good \"La Nuit\" in a golden middle - look for 2012-2014 as I said. I have 3-4 hours of good longevity before it will become skin scent with my 2013 version. And for those who has a better skin it will be even longer, 5-6 hours. So it\\'s very nice.   So, like a conclusion.I love the scent and it really deserves good words about it! I don\\'t say that using it girls will literally fall near you, it\\'s not a magic pill :) But they will like it!So first try to smell it somewhere to test if you generally like it. And if you decide that you like it - go for it!Hope my opinions will help someone :) Sep 18 2016',\n",

Even he admits now that the reformulation has ruined this scent. I think YSL thought that they're getting enough attention with this one that they should water it down and try to maximise their margins. Regardless I thought I'll purchase it and maybe because I don't have any prior version to compare it to, I'll still like it. And I was right, such a beautiful scent, the opening is extremely fresh and the sweeter dry down is so scintillating. But this lasts about half an hour. The performance is TERRIBLE. It's actually abysmal, the drydown smell starts about 15mins into spraying and then after an hour you simply cannot smell this fragrance unless u put your whole nose on to skin. I actually returned my perfume after buying it, wasn't going to be happy having wasted my money on this rubbish. If only they bought back killer performance I'd buy it again otherwise it's totally not worth it. Dec 16 2018\",\n",

If you grew up wearing this and have particular memories attached to the very specific version, I could see why you would want it.However if you are in the market for this and haven\\'t smelt the original, I would say ignore that talk and maybe wonder if sellers are on here trying to build up mythical status to what is now a decade old fragrance who\\'s best days are perhaps in the past.What a lot of people rated as a 10/10 fragrance doesn\\'t suddenly turn into a 4/10 overnight unless it has completely been altered into something totally different. Maybe you could argue it drops to an 8/10 or something, but when the essential DNA of the thing remains fairly close between the two it\\'s hard to justify such drama.

After doing some research I started to see reformulation talk, and here I am. ( after months of using and enjoying it )The dry down on this cologne ( I am talking about after the 1-1 and a half hour mark ) does smell VERY good. Not as unbelievable as the initial smell, but still holds it's own, the issue is the projection. The projection on the initial burst ( first hour and a half mark ) is fantastic, great projection and great smell. The drydown however, does not project at all. People have to hug me in order to smell me.Now obviously you can say just carry a decant wherever you go, and that IS an option, on the other hand carrying a decant for every 3 hours is one thing, but re-applying every hour and a half is annoying.I will rate this as I think people should, on the initial blast, and the dry down.Initial blast ( around 1 and a half hours )smell 10/10 ( Best mens cologne I've smelt )versatility 8/10cost 7/10projection 8/10 Dry downSmell 7/10versatility 8/10cost 7/10projection 2/10 ( this is the deal breaker )The longevity I get is a solid 4-6 hrsMy overall rating would be a solid 7/10 fragrance.If that initial smell lasted even a BIT longer, or the drydown projected a BIT better, The rating would go up so much, unfortunately that is just not what I get.

Everybody seems to love this one, it is the best seller of YSL, it has a very high perfume score here.So what do I really think about this one? First of all it is indeed a nice perfume. It is not boring, it is not generic. It was a really solid release for the house of YSL, so I think it is not a coincidence the fact that it is so popular. I always liked this one from the very first time I tested it BUT to be quite honest it never blew my mind. I got countless testers from this one through the years - I even have 3 now which I use nowadays - but I never really thought of buying it. It is indeed a crowd pleaser, there is a lot of videos on youtube reviewing this one, highly praising it and creating all this hype that follows it for years.I also have to agree that the reformulations really destroyed this one, not just in terms of longevity or silage but also in terms of the smell. It lost all of its character, especially the dry down was completely destroyed.In conclusion, I think that everyone should try this one, it will always be a reference of a male scent release, it might be an entry scent for someone thinking of discovering the art of scents, but as years have gone by, after so many reformulations I am not so sure that this is a bottle worthy anymore.Follow my scent journey on instagraminstagram.com/scentsexual*This review was written after several full wearings of the perfume and not just after smelling this on paper or on wrist.

The performance was incredible even with one spray. People even 4-5 feet away could smell it. It even lasted several hours.Fast forward to about two weeks ago, I was in a beauty store and tested it on my arm again. Not only does the performance suck, so much weaker, but the entire smell is different from the first time I tested it. Not like crazy different, but enough to disappoint me. The first time it was much more powdery smelling. This time it was a little more on the sweet side. Now here's the weird part. The batch code from the tester bottle that I tested two weeks ago said from checkfresh.com, that it was from Dec, 2016. This makes sense because everything I read online about the 2016 reformulation says negative things about change of smell/performance issues. Now when I first tested it back in 2016, I regretfully never looked up the batch code from the tester bottle, but I'm assuming it had to have been maybe 2015 or earlier because it was SO much better! Much stronger and better smelling.I've never smelled the original formula back in 09, but read it was gorgeous. Keeping my fingers crossed that YSL improves the performance issues for the 2019 batch!

I get a very clear lavender note with a bit of non-descript woods.All this dries down on a ISO E super / woodsy base, so you are left with cardamom, lavender and woods. It's very sweet yet balanced. That's what drew me to this. Unlike 1 Million and it's ilk, this is rooted in a more classical masculinity.The very big con with this, is that this comes with the batch hype that Aventus also has. I own a vintage bottle with the big sprayer, and a 2015 bottle. Both smell fantastic. Perhaps the vintage lasts slightly longer, but the current stuff is still great. I'd say this: If you can, find a vintage bottle. If not, buy a current one and love it.

       " 'Average': \"UPDATE: I recently sprayed this at 4PM before a long night out. At 2AM, I could still smell La Nuit on my arm. It was a skin scent, but still noticeable. Can't argue with that. I can't compare my bottle to a 2015/2016 one, but the formulation code is still the same (C167049/1). I don't get complimented on my fragrance often, but with this one I got great reactions from women a few times.-----------------------------------------I just got my March 2018 bottle of La Nuit in the mail (batch code 38R300T, verified on checkcosmetic). After the initial blast of cardamom, it turned kind of 'stale' (best I can describe it). This passed after about 15 minutes though, after which it turned into a very nice scent. The lavender and wood make for a very seductive combination. I bet women would love this on a man. I've heard people on here say that this is an unisex fragrance, but I don't get that at all. It's very masculine in my opinion.It does sit quite close to the skin, but two hours in and I can still smell it just fine. I do think you should spray more of this than you're used too, though. Even then, I don't think this'll last all day, but I bet it'll be noticeable for at least four to six hours. This shouldn't be an issue, though, as this should be used as a date night scent. To me, La Nuit deserves a place in every collection, if only for the fact that this is a fragrance 'classic'.TL;DR: After the opening, which smells stale to me, La Nuit turns into a great scent. The performance with my 2018 bottle is average, but not terrible. I'd recommend it for date nights and special occasions. I think it's worth picking up. Sep 12 2018\",\n",

It was like a warm cinnamon bun fresh out of the oven with no backbone. Now onto the truth....I FINALLY gave this a chance and all I can say is how stupid I was that I never bought this back in 2011. Scent: This starts off like I always remembered.....A soft, warm cinnamon bun fresh out of the oven. After a quick 15-20 minutes the woods start to come in...YES!!!! Its a heavy, fresh blast of cardamom and lavender up front and quickly starts to tie into the cedar and the slightest hint of vetiver. When the woods come, its game over. Its unbelievable.

This is the version that has that heavy, rich cardamom top with the classy - semi powder dry down. The price point for this bottle wasn't bad, given this is a vintage formula. Strange because the bottle is slightly larger than the current and the cap does not fit either. Overall, this was a good blind buy. If you can come across a verified vintage version, go for it.

       " 'dallasfan95': 'This has to be my favorite fragrance of all time. I can speak to both pre-2014 and the newer formulations. I first smelled this in Macy\\'s in 2013 when I first started college. Sprayed it on my wrist, and at first I wasn\\'t crazy about it. As the day went on, I found myself sniffing my wrist constantly. I went back that same day and bought a bottle. After wearing one or two more times, I instantly fell in love with it. It is a very warm and inviting, spicy, yet slightly fresh scent all at the same time. Cardamom is one of my favorite fragrance notes, so I might be biased towards fragrances that have cardamom, but La nuit d\\'lhomme NAILS it. Ultra sexy fragrance. During my first year or two of college, girls would GUSH over this stuff. You would not believe some of the reactions I received from women, both young and old. This fragrance is actually how I met my girlfriend of almost 4 years. I technically met her through a mutual friend on a night out. But I noticed she kept following me around the bar we were at but had not spoken to me and after a while, she finally came up to me and said, \"You smell really really f\\'ing good and I need you to dance with me.\" True story. However, this is not everyone\\'s cup of tea. It is definitely a bit metrosexual but still on the masculine side, so test before buying. But, I will never be without a bottle of this stuff in my rotation, old or new formulations.Now as for the performance. While the bottle I had in 2013 was almost beast mode on my skin, the newer bottles are DEFINITELY lacking in the performance department. However, I believe the performance issues everyone is complaining about is a bit exaggerated. With the newer formulations I\\'m getting about 6 hours on my skin with moderate to slightly weak projection, which is fine since I wear this mostly for my gf and it became a scent to be worn more intimately for me. Buy a 200 ml bottle since they are cheap, get a decant and stick it in your pocket, and refill when needed. Problem solved. People need to stop worrying about reformulations and buy what you think smells good. All in all, one of my all time favorites that will always have a spot in my fragrance rotation. Aug 08 2018',\n",

I don't know the 2014 or prior formulations, although I had a decant from a tester bottle from a store a couple of months ago that smelled better and performed better. The 100 ml bottle (February 2018 batch) I recently bought however smells more synthetic to me (the ISO E Super is more obvious) and performance is abysmal. I now have 29 fragrances (well, 30 if I include my home fabricated Molecule 01 clone), some of them are rather weak performers, but my new La Nuit de l'Homme is the worst of them all. Instant skin scent. This is the first time I've bought a fragrance and feel like I've wasted my money.

As I'm unfamiliar with the majority of notes that are widely prevalent in perfumery I'm usually only able to compare a cologne to things I've smelled before. The beginning of YSL La Nuit was the smell I encountered upon opening an old can of oil based paint; the cardamom is it?At any rate, after the initial blast, the dry-down is quite pleasing.

However, I have no doubt (as a previous owner of vintage La nuit) that this new bottle is a 100% authentic, it just seems that the company as of 2017 has changed the packaging a little bit, Later I found other guys on basenotes.com and reddit.com who mentioned this new 2017 matte-black packaging of La nuit de l'homme.Now, the scent is for sure not as deep, masculine and mysterious as the vintage! but still nice! definitely smoother and more wearable (I can wear it in cooler summer nights) compared to  the vintage, more versatile in my opinion, longevity is very good, around 8 hours on my skin and a few hours more on clothes, mainly the lavender is what I can still detect after 12 hours! projection however is not great, unlike the vintage this new 2017 formulation does not project after the first 1.5 hours, However, I could still smell slight whiffs up to 7 hours if I went heavy on the sprayer!In my opinion 2017 version is good and still worth it.

After almost 10 years I finally bought a bottle because it seems the youtube fragrance community has grown tremendously along with the popularity of this fragrance into \"hall of fame\" territory. Unfortunately this has been reformulated and watered down in performance and spices. Mostly warn as a sensual intimate close encounter night scent, great for dating or romantic dinners, its pretty much a sweet powdery lavender. Scent lasts 4-5 hrs on my skin, projection fades in under 1 hr but in a date-setting it gets the job done. Depending on how you are, this might come off too metro-sexual or young teen instead of those darker boozy spicier scents for night occasions. Overall this scent is currently overhyped and its still expensive for watered down juice, hope for better reformulation or atleast an actual \"intense\" version of this in an edp.

Don\\'t get me wrong, I like cardamom, like in cardamom tea or biscuits and, why not, also in fragrances. But it\\'s a common ingredient in many perfumes. And it\\'s a common ingredient in the kitchen, at least in my kitchen, and not comparable with precious oud or vetiver or ambergris or some hard-to-come-by resins. So, I don\\'t get what the fuss is about, except for Jeremy Fragrance claiming that it\\'s his \"most complimented\" fragrance. I find it kind of pleasant. But my GF, for example, doesn\\'t like it much, it\\'s too straightforwardly sweet for her (as a male perfume). If it works for you, great.

       " 'FireFlySF': 'La Nuit De L\\'Homme (the OLD formula) was a well made, intimate and very sensual fragrance for men. It was what it meant: a \"La Nuit\". It was a frag for date night that made the man irresistible in the woman\\'s eyes, after a side-by-side romantic dinner, with candle light, fine wine and a box of Christopher Elbows chocolate for dessert...And then...It was totally fine if you wanted to skip...the candle light part :) Having said that, of course it takes more than just a great smell to impress your woman to \"agree\" with you.  As the night went, the scent was very groovy as it enhanced the sentimental side of a man, which I just secretly adored (please don\\'t mistake it with \"physically sexy\". Because to me, it was more sophisticated than that. It was a \"tender lust\". There was something in those notes: cardamom, lavender, wood and vetiver...And for the bergamot, it just gently added freshness in the background. Again, because it was a La Nuit, not a \"parfum de jour\" :)And that was the La Nuit De L\\'Homme I once knew when it just came out :( I can only embrace the memory of it now in my thought. There\\'s is something unsatisfying with the new formula (could it be the lack of cinnamon, or amber, or a floral scent...??? I don\\'t know, as I don\\'t have the nose of an expert). It is still \"nice\", but not enough, in order to give me that tingling, sensational feeling that I experienced before.

This in my eyes, no matter what batch it is, is worth $20-$30 tops, it doesn't even smell expensive.Each to their own. This actually was one of my most disappointing purchases in nearly 3 years.

I decided to repost after wearing it a lot more and becoming more familiar with the world of perfumery. Really a stunner. Just an amazingly sexy and pleasant scent. I only wish this was not plagued with performance issues (or that I would have tried it pre-reform).An immediate blast of cardamom and lavender with a hint of bergamot. It\\'s not a scent that screams to begin with but it is very soft, major lavender with a little sharp tang from the cardamom and bergamot. It stays this way for most of it\\'s span with the cedar and vetiver playing into the original notes towards the end. It\\'s quite powdery and woody, while retaining that lavender bomb feel, in this stage. So much so that I\\'m surprised there is no iris in it. I\\'m not entirely familiar with caraway but perhaps that\\'s what gives this a unique edge. It smells like sex appeal and money. I can\\'t argue with it\\'s class, romanticism and sophistication. A modern dandy kind of a vibe. A euphemism of a masculine but sensitive and reserved lover, if you will.Unfortunately, it\\'s a little fleeting. I get about 3-6 hours with moderate projection. Nothing amazing on the performance end but the scent itself is absolute masterpiece. Inoffensive, sexy, somewhat dark but fresh. I could see this being my go to date frag if I was a single man. There\\'s no age restrictions, time of day, season, nothing... It hits all those marks. It may be better suited to evening wear as the name implies but you could easily get away with it all day, every day and ooze sex appeal... If you\\'re willing to constantly re-apply.

But it is my favorite scent of all time (even the newest I like very much)Now I use a couple sprays of vintage (2010) and compliment it with 4 more sprays with any of 2011-2013 and it works reaaallly well. It will last me a life time since I\\'m using all of them sparingly and storing them in a dark cool environment.For dates I won\\'t use the 2010 because I\\'ll be already in close quarters so no need and the other ones that I have get the job done for that kind of situation.I now have all formulations and compared them.Original and first RE-formulation are really close. I find original just a touch darker in terms of smell, yes it lasts a bit longer than first reformulation and projection is more noticeable. You could wear the original version at a club and easily  get noticed with 5 good sprays. I don\\'t club anymore though lolProjection (2010 batch) I\\'m getting 4-5 hours of solid projection and on my skin for 12+ hour. (I don\\'t have dry skin)I\\'ve tested and studied this fragrance for a couple years now. New formulation performs at its best on clothing spray twice on the same spot on clothingI find 2011-2013 do better on skin in terms of projection. Cannot comment on 2014-2015 because I do not own those but should be same.Add a few drops of water where you sprayed it (after 10 mins) and it boosts in projection. Not sure how that works but it does for me. And I wear this fragrance year round no issues but much better if you wore the latest formulation in the summer since it\\'s lighter juice or get the Frozen one.FYI I have two LNDH Frozen as well and those actually perform better than first RE-formulation of LNDH so if you can still find those get it 4 hours of solid projection (about arms length) and 8-9 hours of longevity however, first RE-formulation has better longevity than frozen. I get 3 hours of projection with 2011,12,13 LNDHI might pick up the Zara\\'s interpretation of this fragrance just to see how it is.2011 to 2015 is the same thing which is first reformulation. So 2012/2014 etc all same thing. 2012 is not stronger than 2014 or 2015 is not worse than 2011 like many say. I used to feel that way but the code BYB02-2 doesn\\'t lie, you can find that at the back and that is the ingredient code basically. One being stronger than others throughout this period could be a psychological thing. If you see ingredient code C1 and/or you see Arabic writing on the back of the box you have 2016  - present.Having said that, there is no denying over those years (2011-2015) the juices\\' colors and bottles are bit different but the formula still the same.Compliments are high but the reason why is because it suits me and my persona (dark unpredictable mysterious appearance lol). And yes it smells good of course. When I asked a few girls what you like about it, a few of them said \"I think it suits you or you smell very unique and different\" and like I said it does when it mixes with my skin chemistry! It is not my most complimented fragrance but when I get a compliment on this one it\\'s over the top reaction. My top 5 complimented fragrance for sure (invictus aqua, prada l\\'homme, rasasi, CAHSEE are my other ones)On a side note, if you wear fragrances that suits you, it compliments you as a person and you will receive compliments.It\\'s a shame what they have done to the original but me personally I can finally rest with my LNDH 2009-2010 vintage hunt.

I actually enjoy spraying a little bit of it on myself right before bed as it helps me relax. It has that vibe.One thing that is strange though. Two notes I want to make. (1) I\\'ve purchased about 20 different EDTs over the past couple of years. I usually will have my wife and daughter do a smell test to see which ones they like the best. Some times you buy stuff to impress women and sometimes you buy stuff because you (yourself) like it.(2) I generally like this scent but this was one of the few fragrances I DID NOT test on my wife and daughter because I wanted to see if they\\'d say something without me TESTING it... I wore it for about 3 weeks and never got any type of commentary on it. This is strange because one of the reasons I bought this cologne was because it was on several \"sexiest frags\" lists and yet I didn\\'t get the compliments that all these other people are saying they get.Yes, I wish the scent lasted longer. So far, Paco Rabanne Pour Homme and Curve (self titled) have the longest staying power.I might put this in my top 10 but not my top 5. Yet, and still, this is probably the only frag I\\'d wear to bed. the key to this frag is NIGHT TIME. Dec 04 2017',\n",

       " 'ReturnToScenter': \"I don't normally get into reformulation issues and production dates, but it's apparently a big issue with this fragrance, so I'll talk a bit about that at the end of this review. But first, the fragrance itself. (Spoiler: this is the 2017 version.)This is a gorgeous concotion. The cardamom is sweet and creamy, very prominent from start to finish. The second most identifiable note is the bergamot, followed closely by the lavender. The lavender presents itself almost like vanilla, and the tart, citrusy bergamot gives an underlying tangy character to those two sweeter notes at the top.As it dries down, the vetiver brings a sort of earthy character to the whole picture, but what you're getting is still very much sweet cardamom and lavender, shaded by the bergamot.It's very well balanced, it smells fantastic, and I think it's a fantastic fragrance.BUT.What everyone has been saying in all of the reviews below is absolutely true concerning the longevity. My bottle is from January of 2017, and while I haven't had the pleasure of trying any previous versions, what I do know is that this particular version evaporates in less than two hours. (The stuff I sprayed on a tester card at the mall lasted longer than this, so maybe it's true that tester bottles are older formulations, or purposefully made with stronger formulas.)It's not a strong, overpowering scent to begin with, and that's fine, but even with more tame fragrances, I expect them to stick around for at least four hours. I don't mind having to re-apply a really beautiful scent halfway through the day. I do mind having to re-apply a fragrance four or five times per day, which is what I've had to do with this current version, and that's not acceptable -- especially at this price.Here's hoping future versions have better longevity, because this truly is a very, very good fragrance.(Final note about longevity: it's been three hours since I applied Nuit de l'Homme to my skin. I have a scent card sitting two feet away that I sprayed YLS's Opium on about eight hours ago. I can smell the Opium on the card more clearly than I can smell the Nuit on my own skin. That's ridiculous.) Dec 01 2017\",\n",
       " 'cvaile': \"The current formulation IS literally watered down (on the box, the ingredients go Aqua-Parfum now, where on the first two it was Parfum-Aqua) - good thing is, you can find the 200ml bottle for a more reasonable price than before and just double your application.Treat it like am EDC (which is kind of what it is now) - buy your bottles big and often and spray like there's no tomorrow.This gives you the useful option of a moderate application, but you can still get to beast mode, and with the cost reduction you're probably still spending about the same amount over time, you're just buying the bottles more frequently.Just let the excess water evaporate from your spray-a-palooza and there you are, still on the happy train to that amazing, life-altering drydown.

The fact of the matter is that reformulations occur because of EU restrictions on banned ingredients used in previous formulations. This is what killed the magic of La Nuit. Once they are banned the fragrance must be reformulated and will never be quite the same. Obviously, it can't be without the original ingredients. The makers try to come close but because of the ingredients that were banned in this case it made La Nuit incredibly weak.I've collected this fragrance for years and can confidently say the 2009-11 years are legendary. A true masterpiece that draws an immense amount of compliments. I've never experienced anything like it. If you find any, you would be wise to grab them and experience the original formula.

       " 'Escenta': 'Quality: 4 out of 5 – It’s a beautiful, high quality scent. I didn’t like this when I first smelt it on a tester card or even when sniffing it off the neck of the bottle. I just didn’t get the big deal. I’m the same with D&G The One, even though I got it anyway! But, I gave it another go based on so many people talking about it on YouTube; many who I respect and know their juices. Well, I’m glad I did.Originality: 3 out of 5 – This is different, but I feel like I’ve smelt something similar to it before. I just can’t remember what it was.Projection (Sillage): 4 out of 5 – heavy; People can smell you coming. I used one spray to each side of the neck; this is appropriate.Versatility: 4 out of 5 – This scent is very versatile; it works well for day/night AND autumn/winter AND dressed-up/formal occasions, for men over 25.Value: 3.5 out of 5 – just under £60 for 100ml is the going rate for a fragrance of this quality from a designer brand. If it’s on sale, great!Compliment Frequency: 5 out of 5 – I went to the bank within minutes of spraying this. The cashier said ‘OMG, you smell great, what is that?.’ She continued chatting and we ended up speaking for 5 minutes about fragrances before anything else. She mentioned she also loves what her manager wears - ‘Creed’. I asked which one but she didn’t know. Before everyone yawns, I bet we’d all take a bet at Aventus right? Regardless, this got a reaction I didn’t expect and within minutes. It also turned heads; I caught one woman doing a top-to-bottom ‘scanning with her eyes’ behind me at Tesco! So, if you’re after all of this, this fragrance will leave you feeling higher than a giraffes genitals!Packaging (Bottling): 3 out of 5 – The bottle and sprayer are functional, but nothing special, aesthetically.Overall Rating: 4 out of 5 – Great – This fragrance does just about everything you could ever want from a fragrance of its type (meaning it’s good enough for a lack of originality and plush bottling to ignore). There aren’t any significant problems with the fragrance, but you are not left in complete awe, either.Recommendations: Try before you buy. If you’re in it for the compliments, do a blind buy.

I am not sure at all what batch/formulation it is, but here's my detailed review:Scent: 8/10I would consider it a general crowd pleaser...not amazing, not ground-breaking, fragrance enthusiasts would probably find it ''boring''(dry down does not differ a great deal from the opening) however I think it is overall very nice. The best way to describe it is a ''sexy'' pleasant and classy, sweet lavender with a very faint but noticeable powdery touch. To me Lavender is the most prominent note in thisLongevity: 6.5/10Although it was a skin scent by this time, I was able to still detect this faintly after about 10-11 hours of applicationSillage/Projection: 6/10Each time I wore this I would apply a total of 9 sprays. 2 at each side of the neck, 4 at the front base of my neck and 1 at the back of my neck. for the first 2 hours this projected surprisingly well to what I expected based on the reviews I have read.As I was walking down the hallway at school I could smell the scent rising and projecting. roughly at no more than arms length. Sadly though after about 2-3 hours this was a skin scent.Weather:Autumn(Fall) and WinterWho could wear this?:I personally think it can be worn by anyone who is well dressed, as the scent does have a classy/formal vibe. as for age?, I think the ''perfect'' age to wear this would be mid twenties. Although as I said above can be worn by anyone who is well dressed... I myself wore this at school and with the smart looking uniform it worked really well. So It definitely is great for teenagers to wear. The same goes for the older crowd.Where to wear this/Versatility: 8/10This fragrance to me gives off a classy and formal vibe as well as a bit of sexiness ;) so it would suit well with a suit (pun intended) it could also be worn at places like school, college, office, wedding or even casually depending on the person.Uniqueness: 8/10 I have not really smelt anything too much alike to this.Would this be safe to blind buy?:Considering the price and all of the poor performance reformulations. I would probably not recommend blind buying this. However if you like sweet lavender scents and have the money then go for it. Sep 20 2017\",\n",

I will tell you that I blind bough this fragrance in 2013 after seeing Jeremy fragrances review. He called this the best fragrance ever. I disagree. This was a very good fragrance that has been beaten to death by reformulation. The scent starts of fresh and spicy initially and completely changes later on. If you ever seen a Youtuber spray this on a test strip for a woman, then have her give an opinion it, don\\'t waste your time listening. The opening of this fragrance is okay, nothing special while dry down is magical. You will be blown away by how good you smell. The dry down it is sweet and powdery making it smell unisex. Many women loves this smell since it is not overly masculine and smells very subtle.This fragrance is meant to be worn in cool weather at night but it’s so much more versatile than that. You can wear it to work or casually on a cold day through spring, fall and winter. Do not wear this for outdoor events or clubbing. This is a close encounter fragrance that was designed for intimate seduction.This fragrance has a weak projection. People have to super close to smell this. Don\\'t fall for the \"2016 batch has doesn\\'t project hype\". The early batches don\\'t do all that well either. Now the longevity on this batch though is 6-8 hours so that where this beats the newer ones. Funny thing is this gives me decent silage. People compliment when I\\'m leaving rather when I\\'m just around them. Weird I know.When buying this I thought it was going to get me laid and be a super compliment monster (I was young and in college). This taught me that there is no such thing as a panty dropper fragrance. People who do smell it will compliment you though and no one will ever say you smell bad. DO NOT BUY AN EXPENSIVE OLDER BATCH OF THIS. It\\'s not worth it. I\\'ve seen bottles of this go for $180 on EBay. Don\\'t do it. Move on to something. Even Jeremy Fragrance has moved on. This was a successful blind buy due to him but now my bottle is ending. I will not be buying another.

They will buy it ten years in a row and don’t notice the weaker performance because the invest no thoughts about their scent. But to me it’s a disaster what they did to this scent. It’s the reason why I will never buy it again. Maybe it’s part of the game that heroes like this scent will disappear and make space for new stars. The scent is like Mike Tyson.

Because it's the same fragrance. YSL watered down La nuit de L'Homme because I see the juice color gets lighter. Learn some chemistry people. It's just artificially color. The 2016 is still good as hell, not to say it may be better because there's less artificially color in it. Do yourself a favor. Whenever there's an ongoing discussion about reformulation, please steer clear from it because you will be wasting your time just like me. I tried and tried to find an earlier version of La nuit for what? The same thing with a higher price. The original La nuit was never a powerhouse.

       " 'michaelwarming': \"Before I write my own interpretation of this scent, this needs to be stated; it's a compliment monster - a female compliment monster more specifically. Females flippin' love this. It's addicting, sexy, comforting, masculine, cozy, safe. Their words.I must disclaim that my relationship with this fragrance is somewhat odd, which also is what makes it very interesting to myself.To me, the dry down (on skin) is where it's all at. Just smelling this newly sprayed or even dried down on anything else but skin I get, embrace yourselves, Axe. Synthetic, generic, alcoholy Axe deo spray. Not gross, but far from pleasing and/or sophisticated in any shape or form. If I'd smell this without knowing the dry down on skin and/or how a majority of females react to this I'd press charges on YSL for selling this scent for the price they demand. However, knowing the dry down, and also what the scent does to me and females smelling it on me... makes me want to stock up on more bottles. So you can see that there's two very opposite edges to this sword. To further complicate things, the projection is non-existing and the longevity is borderline okay at best. It's a very skin tight scent with absolutely no sillage - so you, or the one you want smelling it, need to get really close to notice it. But once you/they do, lord have mercy.Takes a few uses to find how many sprays you need, I would suggest experimenting with that in solitary before taking it onto the field. Woody cardamom in the foreground and lavender dressed in sexy bergamot in the background. Personally think it works year around but I can see how some would find it a bit deep for summers. This fragrance is very hard to rate by numbers since the valleys are so steep and the hilltops are so high. Taken out of its context, it's nothing - let it transform in symbiosis with you and it's everything. If you're looking for a scent tailored to please a female in close encounters - this is the one.Scent: 3* & 8**/10Projection: 2/10Longevity: 5/10* on its own** dried down on skinRating: 8/10Reviewed source: I own it.

       " 'Chiru': \"I've been holding off doing a review on this one even though it's in my Top 5 of all time. Make no mistake, this is a 10/10 fragrance. At least... it used to be. And this is why I've held off on reviewing this one. As everybody and their dog is already aware by now, it's been reformulated to perfume hell. While other fragrances usually get a reformulation few and far between, La Nuit has been violated over, and over, and over again by Yves Saint L'Oreal with no shame. This garbage is now bottled water at full designer price, again wit no shame. Newest reformulation (are we even keeping count anymore..?) lasts 1-2 hours on my skin and I've basically given up on it. Don't bother. Keep an eye out for whether or not we get any 2017 reformulations for the  better, as by this point everyone is tired of L'Oreals shit and has stopped buying this, or removed this from their most worn scents. The 2009-2014 scents are soft, sensual, heavenly cardamom flowery woody goodness that make women melt. This is one of THE best scents to impress women. Nobody even cares how common and popular it is because it just smells so damn good. It is my #1 scent for making an impression to women and it has never let me down. Ever. Honestly, this makes me melt too. This will make you want to have sex with yourself just by smelling it. I think this is a manly fragrance that works on men the best. However, if a woman wore this scent, I'd want to eat her up, it'd be so attractive. It's just so good. Longevity of my 2014 bottle is about 6 hours, with 2 hours or so of projection. Not as good as 2009, but still is fine in my book. Really, anything that lasts at least 6 hours is acceptable to me. On my skin, I can still smell a faint skin scent at the 10 hour mark, but it mostly does die away at the 6 hour mark for me. Pretty damn impressive. 2009 bottle I've since finished long ago and it was easily 10 hours on my skin, with 4 hours of projection and I've forgotten when it died down because I usually went to bed. The next day I'd still smell it faintly...So, 2014 and forward? Ranging from perfume water to bottled water with some of the worst longevity, altered, boring, extremely weak smell. Lasts 1-2 hours max, you can barely smell it. Enough said. It's trash. And it makes me really upset. If you've never smelled the originals, or even the 2014 version which is still weaker than the 2009, you may probably still like the newest reformulations smell. But after you smell the original vintage, you'll hate the new one for how weak it is. Your mileage may very.All in all, this was my go to scent for just about everything way back when. Thanks to the IFRA and the greed of Yves saint L'Oreal, it's now a mass marketed, money grabbing product instead of a piece of art. Just riding the coattails of the hype it got so many years back in order to milk whatever money it can from young men who read stellar reviews about what it once was. That's really all I have to say, it's watered down garbage now. It used to be legendary, but I guess all legends fade into history at some point in time. 2009-201410/10 across the board, with weaker longevity, but still a close scent in 2014, while the silage of 2009 was a perfect 10/10, 2014's is a 7/10. Scent itself remained mostly identical during these years, with it being slightly different and weaker in 2014. A masterpiece.2015+2/10 across the board, mostly due to me being bitter. The bottled water you spray still has a smell that resembles the La Nuit, so I guess it's still worth checking out to those who've never smelled this before. Jun 03 2017\",\n",

Although it's not as warm, woody or dark a fragrance as I personally prefer, it's certainly a smooth, sophisticated masculine scent that shouldn't offend anyone and inspires a feeling of confidence. Safe for professional wear if applied moderately, but still suitable for a night out.I'm getting more sillage and projection than most other people here, surprisingly. It's a little sharp upon initial spraying, but soon dries down to a more refined scent. Usually I either love or hate a scent, but this one is a definite like. I'm deeply in like with this one, but it ain't love. When it comes to designer scents, I'm more a Dior Homme Parfum kind of guy. And niches are a whole other story. But still this is a nice scent. I'd wear it if I was going somewhere very conservative. Which, since I work in the creative industries, is fairly infrequent.I never experienced the earlier versions of this scent, so I'm approaching this from a totally fresh (or naive) perspective.Also getting a kind of smokey vibe from this. Not when I sniff it directly on my skin, but when I move around normally, there is a vaguely smokey scent. Strange, since it's not one of the notes listed.My girlfriend likes this.

It was the bomb in those days, something different from Bleu de Chanel, L'Instant d'Guerlain Intense, Dior Homme Intense, One Million or A Men, if anyone remembers any of these. Yes, underdog is the word for it. The best bet for any unassuming young man wanting to compete with the big guys. Dominique Ropion is a genius, but I wouldn't have paid any attention or become such a fan of him if I did not come across La Nuit. Fast forward to today, it's finally getting the recognition it deserves (no. 1 on Fragrantica!), but it seems to have been reformulated. Now, this is really sad news. It had so much potential to be a world-beater. But it got stopped in its tracks it seems. I wish I'd got a bottle of it way back then. May 01 2017\",\n",

Yes, yes, I know that for this review to have any validity, I would need to have worn this fragrance for X amount of time. To you I say, behold the field in which I grow my f***s.. and thou shall see that it is barren.

Pretty simple smell, but really seductive. Lavender, cardamom, cedar and bergamot. It's a pleasant smell that makes me feel sexy, cliche as that might sound. A word of warning though, this is quite powdery, so if you are not into those kind of scents, stay clear of this one.Unlike what other have mentioned for batches in the recent years, I actually get decent performance out of this one, pushing 8 hours longevity, 3-4 hour projection with decent sillage. Definitely a cold weather fragrance and I only really bring it out for when I plan on being intimate with someone, La Nuit definitely shines as a date night scent, possibly as a pick up scent if planning on going to a not so crowded bar.

A safe scent that can be used for just about anything.The 2015 era batches are actually the best smelling batch of all to me. The older batches were annoyingly spicy.

For me the skin scent lasts for 12 hours easily, however I am not sure if others would be able to smell it.Overall this is an 8.5/10 and something worth owning.

The drowdown is where the MAGIC happens and the perfectly blended cedar and lavender emerges in a crackling and bubbling manner that sticks fairly close to the skin but has good sillage.  Where the top note smells like potpourri the dry down becomes masculine and a truely great scent.  Go heavy on the trigger because this stuff doesn't project particularly well and it lasts on the shorter side of what's acceptable of an EDT.  Obviously this is a evening scent and it does best in the colder weather.  I would not think twice to wear this on a date or an evening out in the fall or Winter.   It's not an office scent but I break the rules and wear it to work because I've gotten great reactions from young female coworkers and I'm my own Boss.  I would not wear it around a select segment of my clientel though.  It's too sexy! And clearly targeted at younger women HOWEVER as a man you can wear this at any age.The real reason to buy this fragrence is that young women REACT to and LOVE this fragrance.

This is a fragrance that can be used on any occasion - formal or casual, and it\\'s bound to get you compliments.There is a lot that has already been said about how the fragrance smells, so I\\'ll leave it at that.However, my two cents to would be that YES, the various formulations of this one matter a lot. I\\'ve had one bottle that lasted me all day 8 am to 6 pm (with slightly expected degradation - of course) to another bottle that lasts me 4 hours and needs a touch up in the afternoon. With that being said, you\\'ll never really know. If you\\'re looking for a vintage bottle, don\\'t bother wasting your time and just buy the new version. It still smells amazing, just doesn\\'t have the longevity this was KNOWN for (key point there). It  does not mean that it\\'s not an amazing fragrance just because it doesn\\'t last as long (or project as much) as it once did before. If you\\'re curious about it, try it.

Unfortunately though, like many people have said, the performance was awful! It lasted no more than 2 hours on my skin. I can't justify buying a full bottle of this stuff and blowing through it in a few months because it doesn't perform. I'm not sure what batch that was but I doubt it was a vintage batch. Unfortunately I have never smelled a vintage batch of La Nuit so I have nothing to compare it to. I also think it's completely ridiculous to pay the absurd prices that vintage bottles of La Nuit are commanding now. Even Jeremy Fragrance, who has spoke so highly of this fragrance again and again has acknowledged that the reformulated versions of La Nuit suck. I really want to love this fragrance but I'm not wasting my money on it. It doesn't perform well for me and there are so many other great fragrances out there right now that are arguably just as good and do perform well. I also can't be the only one who thinks the bottle and the ridiculously oversized and cheap looking cap of La Nuit De L'Homme are hideous.Rumor has it that the late 2016 bottles are better performing so maybe there's hope for this fragrance after all. As of right now though I will look elsewhere. I think there will be a lot of exciting releases in 2017 so I don't really see the point of getting hung up on this fragrance. Jan 15 2017\",\n",

It\\'s an alluring scent, in the office I notice how my lovely female colleagues seem to come weirdly close to me and some of them have told me I smell good. Last time I wore this on a date she told me \"I\\'ve been sniffing your neck all night because you smell so good\" and she asked me what I was wearing.I got my hands on a sample of this in 2014 and was like \"this is the best thing I have ever smelled\". When I got myself a 2015 bottle (62M403) I noticed that something was a bit off compared to the sample, it had an alcohol smell in the opening that my sample didn\\'t have and the smooth cardamon note was toned down and it smelled a little bit sharper. I did some research and found out about the reformulations and have since gotten my hands on a 2013 bottle (38K900) with the darker juice color. When I smelled it I was like \"Yes, this is what that old sample smelled like!\"Don\\'t get me wrong, the difference isn\\'t huge but the older batch just seem to have higher quality ingredients. After testing both bottles extensively I also feel that the difference in performance is exaggerated. My 2015 bottle still performs better than D&G The One EDP, CH Men and any fresh scent that I own.

After about 5 minutes it adds a light powdery smell to the mix, a bit like le male. The dry down is the best bit, sweet, creamy and seductive but still manly at the same time. It lasts 8hrs + on my skin but it sits close to the skin. If you want it to radiate, you would probably have to spray about 6-8 sprays depending on your skin. I spray 6 and it doesn't project that great, only if the person is really close, which isn't a bad thing I guess if the person you want is going to be close to you, but not good if you want it to project.It can be worn day/night and any time of the year. Its not too loud that it can't be worn during the day and it's not too cloying that it can't be worn during summer. It is quite a flexible fragrance; sure it may dry down to a sweet, creamy and seductive scent but it's not too harsh that it is inappropriate, it is light but noticeable which in my opinion makes it okay to wear anywhere. All that really matters thought is that you're confident and happy wearing it. Jan 07 2017\",\n",

       " 'EauSensuelle': \"This perfume is absolutely beautiful. La Nuit de L'Homme is probably not as dark or as nocturnal as the bottle or the branding may suggest, but it is certainly a very captivating and enticing fragrance. This YSL number starts off with a lot of cardamom, which is aptly strong and decadent in this fragrance. The note is crisp, warm and very classy; it clearly reflects the high calibre of the fragrance. Hints of lavender combine with this cardamom to give a very unique combination that I've never smelt before.With every passing second, Nuit de L'Homme reveals yet another surprising facet of the many facets it possesses, and the middle is no exception. While the cardamom-lavender gameplay is key to the thought behind the scent, the musk, vanilla and bergamot play pivotal anchoring roles that help structure the fragrance and give it an intense, heady character that still isn't overdone. Very commendable.The base is incredibly soft, with the final traces of lavender projecting away softly. The fragrance becomes floral to quite an extent after a certain point. A hint of cedar adds a bit more depth and interest to the lavender-musk drydown. I'm very glad to be writing the review for such a fragrance on New Years' Day. I think it's safe to say I'm in love with La Nuit de L'Homme, a fragrance that excels in finding the right balance between creativity and elegance. Jan 01 2017\",\n",

I really can't say much other than this is a true masterpiece of a fragrance, it provides something unique, a certain sensual yet ecstatic vibe to an individual. I actually first tried this fragrance out on the advice of a Youtuber, and I don't regret it. This was the first fragrance where for the first time I actually closed my eyes in enjoyment when I smelled this. It has a strong sweetness to it accompanied by a warm flush of spice that goes hand in hand with an even sweeter dry down. Performance wise, it's nothing to write home about, I get a decent 6-8 hours on it but I'm sure that the reformulation didn't help in regards to its performance. However it does sort of counteract this performance with a relatively strong projection and a decent sillage. I have met some people that dislike this fragrance and attribute it to a potpourri smell, and I've had people that have given me extravagant compliments. This a fragrance worth getting, no doubt about it, its price isn't going to decimate your wallet and it's an experience that needs to be witnessed first hand.

I have a 2016 batch - don't exactly know what this means or how it stands compared to the other batches but all I can say is I didn't notice any issues performance-wise. Scent-wise, this fragrance is just too amazing for words. It's warm, inviting and spicy, while being sophisticated and urban at the same time. It's one of those fragrances that has the ability to smell very masculine one moment, and one hour later you find this could very well be a unisex smell. Although the name suggests otherwise, I think this could work as a daytime scent as well. I wouldn't wear this late-spring, summertime as it could get too heavy too fast.

       " 'Vivek15': 'Ok guys, sorted out. I used to think that a bottle may be spoiled but never believed that it could be counterfeited. Well, my reaction was obvious because when you own 2009 formulation for years and try something which is a fake, its gonna break your heart. So I tested the 2015 version and finally bought a new bottle. A lot is being discussed on YSL reformulation so I thought of coming here again and give my honest opinion. So my testing so far reveals that - new 2015 juice is a bit lighter greenish in color, the old one was  a bit dark greenish in composition. The opening with prominent cardamom is not there but there is some hint, I guess they tried getting that smell with some other materials but I am not able to understand what it is. I wont get into notes, you all know it but believe me it is still very near to the original, less that cardamom tinge. One more observation, people claim to have monster projection and longevity, believe me guys it was never monstrous in original as well. It is a great creation, those who owned the original know what I mean. It worked great in close proximity, stayed for at least a day on fabrics when sprayed. Amazing experience which is hard to explain. My new bottle gives almost 2 hours of projection which is same as I used to get with 2009 bottles. It becomes close to your skin but stays there for hours the way it used to linger on old ! The longevity on skin was anywhere between 7 to 10 hours depending on your application, now I am getting around 7 to 8 hours consistently. My colleagues asked me many a times in this short testing as to what I was wearing. So my testing concludes, if you never tried the old formulation, you will still love it. If you know the old, you might not appreciate as the new ones are missing cardamom. But if you loved it and want to keep coming back to monsieur Yves, please do so. It is still a great possession guys. Love makes life live... Love and peace !!! Sep 04 2016',\n",

It’s airy and light with fresh, warm spices that have some floral qualities. Opening with the intense spiciness of cardamom followed by the freshness of the bergamot and the subtle calming floweriness of the lavender, cumin and vetiver provide the earthy/woody base of which is such a fitting end to such a sensual fragrance. Longevity is long lasting on me, anything from 10-12 hours whereas the projection is slightly less lasting 8 hours, for such a nice aroma that La Nuit De L’homme has its performance is great in my eyes and I don’t even know what batch I have, nor do I even care. I wear this fragrance during the winter evenings dressed up to the nines going to a restaurant or bar.Overall, this fragrance and its aroma will have you hypnotised with its seemingly sultry smoothness that mesmerises others that especially come in close quarters of you, one for the sophisticated, confident man and undeniably one for the man of the night.

I sniffed it once and then wore it a couple of times when testing a couple of perfumes when just having a look/sniff around.  The sales assistant at the shop knows his stuff (it's an independent business which has been going for over a century) and this was one of the two he suggested I try.  I did and thought it was lovely.  It stayed in my mind for some time and so when I noticed that people were beginning to complain about reformulations, I thought I would get hold of a pre-2015 batch, a classic original batch, if you will.  I notice that the pre-2015 versions (which I've not tried, I admit) are going for progressively sillier prices on ebay and similar places.  So I decided it was now or never and I took the plunge and bought a 2014 batch, for about 35ml for £28.  I'm glad I did.  It's nice.  I like it.  But - and whisper this quietly - I don't think that it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  I don't think that it is a great perfume.  It's good, but not great, not worth silly prices.  It's rather sweet and projects heavily at first with the sweetness of the bergamot and cardamom blasting away along with the caraway giving it a certain sharpness.  But it soon settles down and improves with a little time.  It improves as the lavender, cedar and vetiver replace the bergamot and the cardamom settles down.  The scent lasts for around 10 hours or so so you certainly got your money's worth for durability in the old one.  Again, I repeat, I haven't tried the 2015 or 2016 versions so I can't give you a comparison but I'm prepared to believe those who say it has only a fraction of the power of the original because the juice is a much paler colour so you can visibly see that it's been reformulated and that it wasn't just a rogue batch or two.  Will I buy a 2015 or 2016 reformulation?  No.  Will I buy a 2014 or earlier batch again.  No.  Would I be disappointed if someone bought me a bottle of the classic for a present?  No, I'd be moderately pleased.  This is nice and if you like sweet woody spicy fragrances then I recommend it highly to you.  But for me?  Well, I've got a list of discontinued perfumes that I want a lot more than this that require paying progressively higher prices so I don't think I'll be after a top up unless they change it back to something much closer to the original.

This cologne, like everything I've smelled from YSL, is unbearable. Some scents are more and less pleasing to me, but this actually induces a headache.  At first I thought I might have been overwhelmed by smelling so many new fragrances in the store, and based on the positive reviews, I sprayed some of this on my skin instead of on a card.  2 hours later, every wiff I got of it made my headache worse.  Even after scrubbing, this haunted me until I showered the following morning.  My girlfriend also HATED it.  Maybe its just my body chemistry, but this seems like a polarizing scent.  Based on the reviews, many people love it, but I assure you, there are also many people who will leave the room when you enter because its so cloying.  Seriously overwhelming, chemy smell.My go to's are Terre D'Hermes, Versace Pour Homme, Givenchy Gentleman casual chic, and on special occasions depending on the season, Creed Aventus, Tom Ford Tuscan leather, TF lavendar palm, TF Costa azzura.

I have a very neutral body chemistry, so fragrances tend to smell true on me and I can usually get the expected 4-6 hours of detectability out of a toilette. This fragrance is in a whole other league. I only use one spray to my chest, and that is plenty. The first 1-3 hours the silage is very intense. It will enter the room before you do. Because of this I'm careful wearing it around people who might not like the scent when I first put it on, because it could easily knock someone out. The next 4-6 hours still have a powerful silage, though within arms length and more what you would expect from a fragrance. 6+ hours I still get wafts of it on myself, but it's less noticeable to others.The scent itself is DIVINE. Absolute heaven. Cozy, warm, aromatic. On me it smells like rich cardamom mixed with fresh lavender and hint of deep woodsy notes underneath. Because it's such a relaxing and strong fragrance I'll usually put it on before bed to help me calm down, and since I'm alone it won't accidentally offend anyone around. After applying it at night, I can still smell it on my pajamas the next morning. Seriously this stuff lasts and lasts. I can't imagine anyone not liking the smell, but I did get a complaint from someone sitting next to me at a sporting event once (perhaps because of the strength rather than the notes themselves?).

       " 'LuxAestiva': \"I am lucky to have bought a 200ml/6.7 oz 2011 batch bottle in 2013. I had a long obsession with fragrances, but hit a long dry spell by 2013 after becoming bored with the current offerings until my passion for fragrance was reignited by this masterpiece. I loved it so much that I bought the biggest bottle possible. When I first bought it I was in love and used it daily for over a year, but then felt the need to take a break from it of it and stopped using it since then. I am left with roughly 45% of a bottle left and rarely use it, especially finding out how it has been butchered by reformulation. The 2011 that I have is pungent and has great longevity on even my fragrance guzzling skin. It's full of spice, lavender, incense, herbal notes on a base of creamy wood. It's so soothing on rainy days and received loads of compliments with its radiant sillage and everlasting longevity.I decided to try my bottle vs a reformulated bottle to see if it was really as bad as people claim, and unfortunately the reformulation is tragic. The reformulation is recognizable, but so weak and missing the richness and depth of the 2011. It's like comparing skim milk to cream.. they're both dairy, but one has substance, depth, richness, while one feels watery, weak and boring. The 2011 has this really pungent, aromatic fullness to it that just uplifts and fills you up with contentment, but the new version doesn't move me at all. This should be renamed La Tragédie de l'Homme. I'm done with YSL fragrances after they pulled this bait and switch. Maybe they should stop focusing on trying to change their image and name and focus on quality. May 12 2016\",\n",
       " 'TechGuyZ': \"I have this masterpiece (old bottle from 2010) and I can tell the difference between the new reformulation and old.Staying power is gone from the new one and I believe the difference is the oakmoss that's missing.The old one has longer projection and staying power with 2 sprays (8+hours)and women do love it where I am! I am lucky I still have 40% of the bottle left(only special occasions for me!), but I can say that older women love it (slept with over 16 cougars and 12 cubs within 2 years of using it!!!!!), but now fun is over since the new gf only wants me to wear this around her. She loves the older formulation of DIOR (silver straw) as well which i have!I don't know what's in it, but using lanuit certainly changed my relationship life with this one!  If you can't find the older formulation, try ebay. Every now and then a few sellers put them up for grabs!@Zender, sorry to hear your luck! I hope you find a old bottle and experience it!

I do not believe that the reformulation is bad by any means. It's just not a powerhouse like it once used to be.La Nuit de L'Homme is more of an INTIMATE scent for the night time. I really want to emphasize this. It's not a scent you wear to the club or a scent you wear to work. For me, it's a scent for those intimate nights with your significant other. It works wonders in the winter/fall/spring. Summer in light wearings.Women absolutely love the scent of this, and what's wrong if a girl is stuck sniffing your neck because you smell so good? When I wear this my woman says that she can't get close enough to me! I can put this on 4 or 5 hours before I go to sleep and when I wake up, I can still smell it!

He now has his own apartment, a nice girlfriend and a steady office job. He is confident and neat . He wears a belt and clothes that fit him properly. He now looks like a man instead of a boy.   What I mean is LaNuit shares some traits of Eros. It shares the powdery feel with Eros, without the harsh cloying synthetic notes. It is not as loud and flamboyant. It is more refined and shall I say \"Matured\" rendition. But definately not an \"Old Guy smell\". Thanks for reading.. Will update after another wearing.CJ Mar 04 2016',\n",

It was masculine, mysterious, and dark but completely intoxicating. Something kept me from buying it full price right there in Sephora. Finally, I picked up a gift set with a 3.3oz bottle, aftershave, and body wash for only $34!! I love this fragrance!! Don\\'t listen to all the haters. they can have there own opinion but I love this smell so much! It opens incredibly smooth with the spice from the cardamon and lavender. Then I get the bergamot and caraway, cedar, and vetiver. I definitely can pick up all the notes but the vetiver is probably the least noticeable. The dry down is woody and powdery. Overall the scent is fairly aromatic but still remains on the dark side. Although the name suggests it is only for the \"night\" you can wear this anytime you want. Fall, winter, spring, and maybe even summer (But go easy on the sprays). As for occasions I can see wearing this going out, casually, formally, and even to work. The longevity is really good (At least 8 hours) and the sillage is also good. I sprayed this once on my wrist and I caught wiffs of it for at least 3 hours!! Then the scent dies down a bit but will definitely get noticed. Another positive is that the bottle is really sexy looking!! It matches the juice inside! What an amazing scent from YSL.

       " 'TonyJ': 'Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit De L\\'Homme is a well put together cologne.This fragrance also ranks in my top 5 as #2. It opens with cardamom with a heart that is strong and virile, with notes of bergamot, lavender and cedar. The base is deep and rich with cumin and vetiver. Compared to L\\'Homme this one seems to be the real attention getter from everyone who gets a whiff of it. I\\'ve done a test with well over 10 people and nearly 90% of the people enjoyed the smell of this one over the \"daytime\" counterpart.So pros and cons on Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit De L\\'Homme:Pros - Long lasting (I wore this Christmas night, and it got everyone asking what it was. It also lasted me through the night into the next morning.) You can wear this during the afternoon and it will still be there. Not as strong of course, but still has a great smell. So if you want it for an evening I would wait before throwing this cologne on. It\\'s overall an attention grabber. So for those who enjoy standing out of the crowd. Definitely pick one up if you get the chance.Cons - The sillage is Moderate, similar to its \"Daytime\" counterpart Yves Saint Laurent L\\'Homme.I have not worn it during any other season but winter as well. I am really hoping to see how this cologne reacts during the warm weather since I know most people say it\\'s not really good for Spring or Summer. Just to get a general idea on how it works on me.

       " 'OCNBreeze7': 'Extraordinary… A classic for all generations… Since childhood, “Isabelle” had dreamed of traveling to New York City and visiting the Empire State Building, looking out on the city from the observation deck, and hopefully, seeing the Statue of Liberty off in the distance.  Now that she is older, mid-thirties with a husband and kids of her own, the time came for a  mini family vacation.  Dad could not make the trip – some excuse about important clients and other meetings to attend, which suited the rest of the family just fine.  The trip was huge success, highlighted by a memorable trip to the Empire State Building.  It was a cool and brisk autumn evening when Isabelle, family in tow,  visited the 86th floor open-air deck.  They chose evening to see all the lights of NYC – the evening did not disappoint and the family was awestruck.  It was a dream come true.  Isabelle happened to notice a tour group that shared the same enthusiasm.  One man, in particular – the group leader – caught Isabelle’s attention.  He spoke broken English and would frequently revert back to his native tongue that Isabelle guessed Italian.  He was truly happy and full of life – and it showed, from the inside out. While leading his group on the tour, they passed Isabelle’s family and he stopped to exchange pleasantries with Isabelle.  She noticed his dark eyes and stylish clothing to include his scarf that was clearly not purchased nor made in America.  She was also intrigued by the fragrance he wore as he passed in the night – she thought of the outdoors, herbs, and being out in the woods.  This was a fragrance for professional and distinguished gentlemen.  Under a full and clearly visible moon, she took a deep breath in and savored this moment.  The group tour continued at a much quicker pace than Isabelle’s family and she noticed they made their way back inside and waited for the elevator to take them back to street level and out into the city.  When it was time for Isabelle and family to leave, she noticed a scarf – the scarf – had been dropped by the door.  Isabelle hurried to the scarf and picked it up, finding the name “Nicho” on a label embroidered on one side.  She also noticed the scarf had the pleasant smells of the fragrance Nicho wore.  There were no signs of the group tour inside nor at street level to return the scarf.  Isabelle kept the scarf as reminder of the trip and night a dream came true…  After returning home, and just prior to Christmas, Isabelle was walking through a department store at the local shopping mall when she stopped in her tracks - there it was… The fragrance that permeated the air around her – it was Nicho - it was the “man of the night”.  When she asked about the fragrance – it was La Nuit de l’Homme..  Some people come into your life for a reason… To be continued… YSL’s La Nuit de l’Homme is a beautiful fragrance that should be in any collection.  Geared mainly for Fall and Winter wear and especially for evening events.  It is a crowd pleaser that will garner many compliments – La Nuit is one of a kind.. My final tally of La Nuit is 4.7 stars out of 5 stars.  You will not be disappointed… Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting… Nov 17 2015',\n",

At times it has manifested a peppery aspect, at times woody and on the rare occasion I actually do get some cardamom, never loud and clear, but muted, as if behind a veil of synthetic ambery fuzziness.To summarise the whole composition: a random opening, a heart of anonymous lavender, which then fades into the cheap accord of amber, with a dash of iso-E-super and a pinch of vague, indistinct and artificial spice (I do not get a trace of cumin unfortunately, for that would actually spark some interest into the composition, what I get instead is flat, one-dimensional sweetness).There is no mystery to the composition, which stands amongst the most commercial offerings on the market today, where very little thought and consideration has been given to the composition after the 5 minute mark. Notwithstanding all of this, the fragrance is pleasant, a crowd pleaser, but it seriously lacks in character, depth and complexity and is comprehensively put to shame next to any other YSL creations dating back prior to 2003.A real pity given the potential of the notes listed in the composition, I really do feel the perfumers' budget let the whole project down.

It has the basic vibe of the original though more generic and so much weaker that I wish I didn't go through my old bottles so quickly. The original scent also projected more. The sillage was better as well. So it is very safe to say that reformulations have ruined the performance of this once beastly fragrance. One thing it has going for it though is it is still is a people pleaser but that's another thing that turns me off about it. EVERYONE HAS IT. I tend to avoid overly commercial scents (Eros, L'Eau D'Issey and Dior scents notwithstanding...lol). If a scent is too mainstream in its appeal, 7 out of 10 times, I tend to go the other way. The more popular this has become the less special I feel about it. To be honest though if it's performance was what it used to be, its fame wouldn't matter to me as much. This scent is one of those I reminisce about. I think about those days when it enveloped my personal space for hours with that spicey elegance. I miss those days.

       " 'SelkciPlum': \"Easily the sexiest fragrance I own. Very nice projection, not strong enough to be over powering, but powerful enough to get the attention of someone passing by.  The only thing I don't like is that the newer bottles seem to smell distinctly different. I've fallen in love with the scent of the first bottle I purchased mid 2013, and since then I've smelled a bottle from 2014, and the strength of the notes are considerably different from one another. Whether it was reforulated, or there just isn't much consistency in each lot of bottles, the difference in smells makes me hesitant to buy a another for myself. The newer bottle had lost alot of the 'oomph' that the older scent had, and is overall weaker and feels less masculine.9/10, will likely buy again, but all this reformulation talk makes me sad.

I was suprised cause this is supposed to be a pantydropper.I thought it was okay but I was not shocked. I must have tried the reformulated version which is not as good as the original cause sillage was not that good. Longevity was better but still not great.I also tried the new Intense version of this what started with a bad flowery alcoholic smell (maybe I sprayed too much) and dried down to a really sweet smell which reminded me a bit of Dior Homme Intense but toned down a bit. Longevity and projection on the new Intense version is better than the original, which is to be expected cause it is an EDP. But my girlfriend didn't liked it and my mother thought it was too sweet for a man.La nuit de l'homme: 5/10 (I don't like to give it a bad score cause I really wanted to love it)La nuit de l'homme Intense: 6.5/10 (better longevity and projection) Aug 05 2015\",\n",

       " 'Little Prince': \"I just happened to stumble upon this fragrance the other day while sniffing around at the store. I usually avoid fragrances that carry labels such as “pantydropper”, “ladykiller”, encourage you to buy something for others (in this case chicks… supposedly so sexually interesting to really care to drop their pants) and generally propagate the myth that whoever you are, wear this and…without hyperbole you’ll have frenzied women busting through doors, running over one another, chasing you to death around the city and in short battling whose gonna grab your cock first. Then I reconsidered and thought that it is an YSL and made by Ropion. I really don't understand the craze with this fragrance. Dominique Ropion is a very talented perfumer but I get the feeling that every time a big hitter comes on the selves what has preceded is a conversation of the sort “throw a few pleasant aromachemicals, make it a tad sweet, polish the angles to the point of dullness and let’s throw it in the market to see what happens”. When the first sales start going good then the conversation continues “…well you know it’s just something I “composed” in one day while watching the six o’clock news but what the heck who cares people say it’s good so leave it as is and let’s make a fortune”.  I won’t take time analyzing the fragrance since as with great scents, bottom “compositions” are pointless of analysis and this one certainly flies low. This not because it isn't artistic or whatever banal you may think of but just because it smells wrong. Perhaps the good old days never existed but some firms, YSL included, used to bother making a new fragrance and made great efforts in delivering something noteworthy. This opportunistic new-era ideals and their consequent releases make me wonder where the fuck are we going.But the ladies love it… well I simply don’t! Jul 28 2015\",\n",
       " 'anna.dkr5': \"Upon spraying this, I get a burst of sweet lavender and something that reminds me of black pepper. This accord stays for about an hour on my skin. Imagine sweetness with something dark in the background. It's not the kind of pepper that stings your nostrils, though. You can definitely smell it, but it's still rather smooth. Then, I start smelling bergamot. It's a really nice bergamot note that is very prominent on my skin, and nearly acts as the main player, while the cardamom (and the other notes) acts as a sweet background. This cologne projects moderately (about an arm's length) for an hour, then starts dying down. Four hours into it, it's pretty much a skin scent, and I get whiffs of bergamot mixed with a sort of vanilla sweetness. I love this fragrance, but wish it projected a little more. I wouldn't want to a projection monster, but it would be nice if it were just a little more noticeable. I'll try it on my clothes, too, and see how it performs there. All in all, I'd probably give it a 9 out of 10, mainly because of its weak projection, and questionable longevity.I'd wear this year-round, because it's light enough. It's lighter than Dior Homme Intense (2013), and sometimes I wear that in summer, so I don't see why I wouldn't wear this. Then again, it's a strictly personal choice. Aug 08 2014\",\n",

It is a bit sweet and soft, but also has a definite masculine, sensual, sexy tone to it. I think that really limits its use. I don\\'t think I would wear this during the day to the office or out clubbing. This is more of a \"getting drinks\" scent or a \"intimate dinner\" scent, although I guess it could also work at a quieter classier bar. I wore this on a first date last weekend, and had a 2nd date planned before the first one had even ended. Not the best projection, but ideally, on an intimate night, you and your romantic partner won\\'t be that far apart.

What a disgusting scent this is! First of all it is very feminine. I am amazed it is marketed as male's fragrance! There's something pungent and overwhelmingly powdery about the scent. What's worse is there's a note that resembles sweat in my opinion. It's almost near the limit of being repulsive. And, as is the case with most scents of this type, it is also very strong and overpowering. Two hours after wearing it, it was still causing me nausea so I couldn't stand it anymore and went to wash it out. It is now probably two hours after I have thoroughly washed it off and I can still smell it on my wrist... I can't really understand people who think it is weak. I guess those are people with weakened or malfunctioning olfaction which could explain why they like it :) Sorry, couldn't resist the urge to hate... But I am so disappointed.

Initial thoughts are all positive! Smells great! Warm, amber smells, not powdery. People wrote that the initial spray would smell terrible but i actually think its fine and nice.Then when it dries down - it just smells and evolves into something better. Its not so strong that you feel like you can smell that artificial chemical smell, its very warm and inviting and more importantly not too overwhelming that you get a headache from having it on. Its a sweet, warm smell that has class and isnt overpoweing.  I sprayed about 5 times at 9am and it lasted till about 2-3pm. So in terms of longeivity i think its fine, in terms of sillage its not so strong that people across the office will need to move away. Though its definitely not weak.

To be honest, bought this blind, based on the reviews on this site, just to fill my shopping cart that contained the vintage Paco Rabanne and discontinued jewel  Arpege from Lanvin, that I just adore. I just added this one to the cart in order to get them to Dubai from EBay so that shipping cost spreads over three bottles. I am so glad  I made this purchase and this one is the first YSL that I am loving after trying and discarding  Kouros, Body Kurous, Jazz and Live Jazz. This one belongs to its own elite class and is a perfect masculine scent. I guess this one is all about beautiful balance of the notes used (very few though), with cardamom ruling the roost. This can never be cloying, even with oversprays and probably would never offend anyone. You may not love it but it is very hard for anyone to dislike this.

The scent of this fragrance is 10/10 throughout the entire time it's on my skin but the projection is very poor and the longevity is good if you count it sitting close to the skin. People said it lasted 10+ hours easily. It does last that long but after 2 hours it's so close to the skin that no one notices it.mi did buy a travel atomizer so I can refresh it when it stops projecting but I am still disappointed.

Opening might not be the best but drydown CAN BE!So i waited for like 30 mins and God i was amazed. This truly is a Heaven in a bottle! I got mostly a vanilla vibe along with spices (must be the cardamom) it was a combination of sweet and spicy. Greatness!So after a bit it became a bit powdery maybe the lavender combined and made it powdery. So at last it was left with a powder smell but NOT feminine becoz of the cardamom, it gives the scent its Masculine Vibe.It is definitely a date scent, mostly for romantic moments.Womens die on this fragrance, Believe it or not i got complimented on this fragrance EVERYTIME i wore it.Definitely in my top 10 most complimented fragrances.So ratings by me - ~ Scent - 10/10 - (Wait for the drydown, don't judge it by the opening.) ~ Projection/Sillage - 8/10 (Not a projection beast, but leaves a slight trail, and can be smelled in a hugging distance or like standing close)~ Longevity - 8/10 (Lasted for 8+ hours on me)~ Versatility - 8/10 (Can be worn in any occasion at Night, not the best day time fragrance though)~ Overall - 9/10 (Sexiness at its best) Mar 09 2015\",\n",

In short: I\\'m not huge on this fragrance, but my girlfriend seems to love it.A lot of what I get out of La Nuit is... powder. It\\'s just a super powdery -- almost to the point of floral -- scent, and it\\'s not exactly my thing. It\\'s slowly grown on me, but I\\'m still not a huge fan. I appreciate the woody and spicy oriental undertones to this cologne though, as it (thankfully) takes a bit away from the almost overwhelming one-notedness of the floral powder aroma.La Nuit\\'s a solid cologne, and a bit different compared to what a lot of guys my age (college) seem to be wearing. La Nuit smells a bit sophisticated -- although it is also a bit of a colder weather scent, or at least, a night time scent (imagine that!) That hurts its versatility, but La Nuit smells a bit of class, and just smells... sophisticated. I just find it a touch too powder heavy. I still like it though!Bottle: 4/5 (Simple, sleek -- I like the contrast of light to dark on the glass and the heft of the cap, albeit plastic.)Sprayer: 4.75/5 (Can\\'t really complain here -- no problems with it. Easy access, no-issues-with spray nozzle. Sprays when I want it to, and I can pretty much decide how much I want mid-spray.)Longevity: 3.5/5 (I used to feel like it went forever, but now it seems to lack quite a lot, so I\\'m leaving it here for now, and may edit it in the future. I\\'d say it\\'s slightly below average in terms of longevity.Sillage: 2.75/5 (A quite subtle fragrance in terms of its intensity -- sits pretty close to the skin, and maybe only goes an arm\\'s length out, which is part of why I consider this to be a classy sort of cologne.)Overall: 4/5 (It\\'s just a solid, well-made cologne. Not exactly versatile, but a very nice smelling fragrance regardless. It\\'s not exactly my style, but I can still appreciate it.

The younger girls don't compliment this one that much, the youngest lady that complimented me was a friend and she is 23yrs old. I would say if you want to attract a more sexy mature woman try this scent out!

       " 'That_John_Guy': 'This is definitely meant to be a night scent, after all \"La Nuit\" means \"The Night\" so it is pretty explicit.  The way I had heard about this scent was that it was great for a night of getting cozy.  If you wanted something that would smell great, last all night, but not overwhelm the person you are cuddling up with, then La Nuit was the go-to.  Wearing something really strong with monster projection might overwhelm them.  My expectations were pretty much met.  La Nuit has the interesting character of having decent longevity without too much projection.  I find YSL Pour Homme to be the same, you need to lean in to smell it (unless you really spritz it on).There\\'s something to be said about that.  The moment when someone is talking to someone, not smelling anything, but they need to lean in for whatever reason and then say, \"hey, you smell really good!\"  It gives the impression more that you just smell good than that you are wearing something that smells good.  YSL seems to go for this approach: restrained, reserved on the projection front, but smelling really good.La Nuit is extremely popular (sorry to those who think this is a big secret), so some folks will bash it for that reason.  It isn\\'t a projection monster, so some will bash it for that.  It isn\\'t the most bold scent.  La Nuit doesn\\'t have 20 notes, so some might bash it for that reason.  Yet, overall this is solid, well-known juice that a man should at least try for himself.  It definitely isn\\'t a super-brawny, butch type of masculine though.Having experimented with other fragrances, knowing my preferences and body chemistry, I\\'d probably never buy La Nuit for myself.  Yet, I can see it working well for plenty of guys. Jan 29 2015',\n",

The mid notes, however, take a turn I don\\'t necessarily like. Plastic? Yeah, I smell plastic and flowers. Like Wendy\\'s plastic toys, but not nearly as good. The drydown brings repulsion- I don\\'t think anyone would compliment you once you reach this. I requested many women to smell this on me today (various stages) and the results were not nearly as impressive and decisive as the humorous reviews on YouTube and Amazon seem to promise. This is not a \"panty dropper\" for me at all. It smells okay. It almost takes itself too seriously, particularly since its lack of quality ingredients becomes obvious: it acts like it is well blended, but ultimately remains affectatious. La Nuit de L\\'homme\\'s biggest flaw is its overall boring feel once you actually wear it. It was beautiful on paper, but on my flesh it just produced too many \"bleck!\" notes that probably don\\'t appear on others. The scent just got boring and unwanted on me today. Considering the positive press and jubilant endorsement by fellow fumeheads, I\\'m very much dissappointed. Try on your skin before you buy. Projection is moderate to soft and great longevity (I still smell it, but still not something I enjoy for myself). I\\'m sticking with the even more boring aquatics, which at least make me feel confident inside.EDIT: I\\'ve found this to be the most popular cologne on my college campuses. I\\'ve smelled this far more than 1 Million or even Aqcua di Gio. Be warned, you won\\'t stand out as much as you may think- the curse of a popular fragrance. Sep 04 2014',\n",

However, there was always something not right about the fragrance, I couldn't quite put my finger on it...Until one night, I sprayed it all over my pillow and blanket. Then later the next day, I walked into my room and a very familiar smell hit me like a ton of bricks: Indian Food.I ran back to the store the next day. Luckily, they let me return it. True Story.***Update***I did some research to make sure  I wasn't crazy or got bad bottle. According to the designer, there is Cumin in this fragrance. Not listed as one of the notes here but 100% true there is Cumin in this fragrance.***Update #2***Caraway and Cumin are NOT the same thing. Caraway is slightly bitter/minty and Cumin is somewhat like curry/body odor. Like I said before, I fell in love with this fragrance just like many of you. Unfortunately, when it dries down,  it reminds me of nothing else but Indian food.***Update #3***It's definitely worth checking out Axe Anarchy for those casual days if you like this scent.

As the scent dries down, I get more of the cardamom note. The lavender is listed as a middle note but I get it right off the bat, maybe it\\'s just me though. The scent is very clean, comes across as professional, but could also be seen as as unisex because of the strong flowery notes. Also a bit of a powdery note that comes in with the dry down. Overall, this is a great fragrance. It can be used for every day wear, but my suggestion is save it for the date nights and formal events. As for silage and projection, it lasts for most of the day on skin (about 8-12 hours) and lasts for days on clothing. It is not a \"loud\" fragrance, it leaves a slight trail but nothing major. Most people probably won\\'t smell it unless they\\'re within 5 or so feet of you. My recommendations: 2-4 sprays on your neck/arms, avoid using it during hot weather because it may become more apparent than you wish.Overall, I give this scent a solid 4.5/5.

Maybe it's just bad chemistry between this fragrance and I, but every time I wear it I am left with an aching head and an itchy, rashed arm.  I'm not sure why this scent has so many good reviews, because in my honest opinion it has an overly sweet and incredibly powerful, cloying smell, but again, it could just be because of my skin type.  I had my brother try it as well and he had the same results.  Please keep in mind that both of us are fairly young, and thus our noses might not yet be mature enough or whatever to enjoy the scent alone, regardless of its interaction with our skin.

       " 'garmonbozia': 'La Nuit de l`Homme is a very safe fragrance. I had high hopes for this one but my first thought when I sprayed it on my wrist was: \"It\\'s a very generic scent\".Later on I started to appreciate it more.What can I write about it? It is, what it is. Aromatic scent created from a few simple notes. I sense lavender most of all. La Nuit is nice and elegant. Fortunately I can\\'t sense any vetiver so I was spared from \"soapy grandpa\" vibe.The real problem here is not the scent itself but the sillage and longevity. I must put my nose close to the skin to sense anything. May 02 2014',\n",

After applying it, my wife and daughter commented several times on how \"different\" this scent was and mentioned that if filled the room - great projection.  I think this would suit a large range of men and most occasions, so girls - here\\'s a great present for your man.My newest favourite. Apr 23 2014',\n",
       " 'Lexxy': \"Women really like this! Trust me I'm one ... It's both sexy warm and clean light fresh at the same time. Some sexy warm colognes can be a bit too much and some clean fresh colognes are sometimes not sexy or memorable enough, well this has both, perfect combo. I can see this on a man of any age, easy to wear non offensive. Men colognes should not be too complex or loud in my opinion, they should be simple light with a hint of sexiness. You don't want to seem like you're trying too hard or cover up your own manly scent. YSL La nuit is defenitely not something I would mind a man wearing and I'm not too big on men wearing cologne.

       " 'Dajora': \"Tried this on my wrist today and i absolutely love the smell of it,  not too strong, projects well, floral/aromatic/woody with a manly calm and confident twist to it.i'm at the 5 hour mark now and it's still projecting somewhat decently, although it definitely tones down after the 4 hour mark and you will have to get your nose about twice as close to your wrist to smell it. for now i would say the someone else would have to be within 1 meter to be able to smell it, and in the opening it would project 2 meters away.i'm expecting the longevity to end at around the 8-9 hour mark.i'm almost 24 years old and i became a fan of this scent today, definitely a future buy for me10/10 for what it is: a versatile, calm and manly scent that projects well, but not enough to offend people. I would wear this anytime of the day, fall, winter and spring as long as it's cold outside and i still need to be wearing a warm jacket.UPDATE: 7.5 hours in, smell still lingering and still projecting, i'm even more impressed!UPDATE two: I'm 9 hours in now and the it's fading away, have to get my nose right over my skin to smell it. Might be just me but i think it get a bit of a more fresh kind of scent in the background as it tones down. Apr 01 2014\",\n",
       " 'yuresh': \"my batch is early 2013 and yes i bought it because of the positive feedback here and the conclusion was that is a big difference! yes LA NUIT it was reformulated.....i didnt smelled or used the early aged juice but this one new is weak....WEAK....not even close to the performances other users describe here...I used 6-8 sprays....it projects and people can smell you only in the first 1-2 hours and after that all skin scent for maximum 10 hours....!the smell is amazing still....great one but performances are bad....i'd say is a safe night scent! and yes women still love this one....not a ''panty dropper'' but loved one for the opposite sex! of course when SHE can smell you....an that is when she comes close to you,hugs you....or if she feels La nuit in the forst maximum 2 hours after you first sprayed! all in all i think it's a good fragrance but 100% reformulated!

I tend to wear it only in the latter parts of the day, but I see no reason why you couldn't wear it all the time bar the hot summer days.Performance is great in every area with only 3 sprays needed. Perfect for a date scent or anytime you're wanting to make a good impression. For me it's faultless.10/10 Mar 06 2014\",\n",
       " 'Houdini4': \"To my surprise this is yet another fragrance I thought I'd reviewed or at least posted my review for ages ago...but obviously not.I won't go on too much as pretty much everything that needs to be said regarding this fragrance has been. I get an overwhelming air of sexiness and an alluring quality which I think was exactly it's intention...the perfect mixture of cardamom, bergamot and a hint of lavender. The drydown is superb slightly powdery and a very clean cedar/vetiver.   The citrus and fruity berry vibe comes more to the forefront than the spice which is probably what makes this fragrance so socially excepted and commercially successful. I for one can take a bit more cardamom (the likes of Hypnose) but obviously YSL wanted to strike up a balance that would appeal to many.It's funny how many of my friends who are not into fragrance (that's all of them!) own this fragrance. One of my very good friends told me he wears it almost exclusively now after years of searching for his signature. I should point out that he is a bit of a ladies man and I was informed on good authority that this fragrance was a lady killer and drives them wild apparently? I don't know about all that but I don't see why the average non collector or scent enthusiast couldn't wear this everyday in every situation, just smell incredibly good and be content.I need more variation in my life but I enjoy owning and wearing this on occasion it's an excellent fragrance.

I'm puzzled which note could be the culprit as they are quite common in my other frags with no problems.It must be the cardamom. I'm finding I can handle it in very small amounts, but  when it becomes a prominent note in a fragrance, as it is with this one, I tolerate it far less. Feb 24 2014\",\n",
