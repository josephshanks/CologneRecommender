Especially during the initial, crowd pleasing, fruity blast, women totally love it. Maybe it reminds them of their own perfume. But at the end of the day it's really depend on why you wear a perfume on the first place. If you want to please people, this perfume will not disappoint you one bit. But if you're looking for something new or want to make a statement, well... maybe it's time for you consider other option. But all in all, I'd rate this perfume 4 out of 5.

Pretty much most women will say it's a masterpiece. When I think sexy, sensual &amp; intimate, I think of La Nuit. It's pure sex in a bottle. Women gravitate to this scent, I'm telling you... Now, for the disappointment. The reformulations killed the performance in my judgment, it's practically a skin scent with very little projection with the first little while (maybe an hour or more). So, the big question: Is it still worth it in 2020? My answer is it depends on you. On my skin &amp; my hubby's, it's about a 2-hour fragrance if that, maybe slightly more &amp; that's being super generous. The only realistic time I can see anybody wearing this now in 2020 is in intimate situations, that's pretty much it. It's way too soft for dates, clubbing, etc. I can't even smell it on him unless I'm literally burying my face into his neck basically. Take what you want from my personal experience, but that's the truth. I just don't want people to get disappointed when they buy it. In my humble opinion, there are better options out there you can pick from with better performance &amp; projection... I find this one a bit outdated. YSL should really modernize this scent &amp; re-release it with better performance because it would sell like hotcakes!<br/><br/>\n",

And that has happened to LNDH as many others have observed, it does not, however, take away from the unique originality of this fragrance.<br/>\n",
       "La Nuit De Homme is rich and creamy on the opening, you get bergamot and cedar. It becomes soft vetiver with powdery lavender on the dry down, which may sound feminine, but smells masculine without being overbearing. for me, everything blends together perfectly. Fragrance lovers should own and wear this for at least a season of their life to fully experience it.<br/>\n",

I really don’t care for this one. It’s heavy, cloying, and very artificial smelling. I have over 60 fragrances in my collection, ranging from Sauvage, to several Parfums DeMarly, Creed, and it Byredo. This YSL is one of the last ones I’d ever reach for. Oddly enough it truly smells like my dog’s veterinarian’s office, like either an industrial synthetic cleaner, or wet dog. Big pass for me. Oh and by the way, to the gentleman who left the review below, recommending that you wear this to a job interview if the interviewer is female... NO NO NO!!!! Horrible advice. NEVER EVER wear cologne or perfume to a job interview. Horrible advice. If someone wore this, I’d have them leave ASAP, since I dislike the smell. Pretty basic  stuff... If you don’t own it yet, I’d recommend a sample, or you can buy mine! Happy sniffing.</p>\n",

The scent is just completely linear, it doesn't develop or change in pretty much any way to my nose. It's a nice scent for sure, but I can give you a frag that I never hear anyone mention that has better performance, it's much, much cheaper and in my opinion is an all around better fragrance, especially in the dry down! It's Mont Blanc Emblem Absolute. It opens up with the same cardamom note but paired with pear and a fruit accord that really adds to the opening. The transition to the dry down takes 3 hours minimum, and it doesn't become a skin scent until your 8-10 hours in. It's an often overlooked and amazing option that should definitely be getting more notoriety if people so love this cardamom note.</p>\n",

However I did some research and learned about the different batches. I bought 2 bottles, a 2010 and 2011 batch. This is where I learned that the prime of this fragrance was 2009-2010. The reason this is a master piece is because of those batches. It smells better, projects a lot more and lasts 12+ hours. The 2011 batch is also amazing but that's where the decline began. It smells more fresh and weaker, but still performs better than the newer batches. <br/><br/>\n",

However I must talk about reformulations. I am lucky enough to own all three formulations of this fragrance (2011,2014,2018) and id say the best way to describe them is that the 'Vintage\" is overhyped and the Latest batch is overhated. I get maybe 1-2 hours more MAX on the vintage bottle compared to 2018 and the scent is really only more 'boozy' in the first 10 minutes of the vintage. The difference is small and the vintage is in no way worth the mark up people pay for it. If you like this scent just buy the newer batches, its not worth the money. If you find a vintage, YAY now your gonna be anxious to use it all up...like me...La Nuit De L'homme was never a BEAST MODE fragrance, and the newer formulation while unfortunate, don't ruin the fragrance. PS if you want better performance just use a unscented body lotion and or layer with an iso e super fragrance (Molecule01)</p>\n",

That's the only time it will really last 7+ hours for me, otherwise it's like 2-3 hours in other weathers/seasons. Sillage isn't all too great either as I mentioned; it's very subtle that someone would have to be sitting directly next to you to smell it. Overspraying would be good in this case if you really want the scent to project.<br/><br/>\n",

The longetivity of this perfume is high about 8 hours. The projection of this perfume is moderate. It can be worn in any season especially winter and fall but coming to summer the perfume doesn’t last long. I purchased this fragrance about 8 months ago. This is a classic perfume made by Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit De L Homme. Especially when I wear it in winter I absolutely feel Heavenly feel of the perfume. The perfume is highly Masculine and I love this Fragrance a lot. It is Dark, Mysterious, Elegant and I wear it Day and Night especially in winter and fall. Best perfume on Earth. I will give it 10/10. I am actually new to this Fragrance game.</p>\n",

First I tried it I just did one spray to my inner elbow and it performed well for next three hours, then I had a shower. Right after that I put 3 sprays (2 on my chest and 1 back of the neck), could smell it 5 hours later until I got to sleep. After I woke up I still smelt it clearly, probably only the shirt but 12h isnt exactly a poor performance. Will buy a full bottle of this.</p>\n",

For sure, the thousands of immensely-satisfied users of this fragrance that made it #1 on this website really got it right. And I am most pleased to have been convinced by their overwhelmingly-positive feedback and blind bought this one. And boy, was i in for a pleasant surprise. This one sits very close on my skin - which, like they say, is actually one of its strength for a romantic and dating scent, such as this one. It lasted a minimum of 7 hours on my first application and oozes a romantically-soft, fresh, mildly-sweet, and powdered sexiness. I am just a noob in fragrances but I think the pros are perfectly right, this one is most appropriate for date nights and special night-time occasions, thus it's apt name. Hand down, this one is a 9.5 / 10 for me.</p>\n",

Is that true that 2019 batches of this scent are getting back  a little bit of the power of the 2009-2011 batches of the fragrance , since is very well known that 2016-2017 were so so weak in performance .So , the 2019 formulation is more powerful from your experience ?

I was blown away when I smelled the dry down, that powdery sweet. heaven It made my heart melt, I instantly recognized cardamom which is one of my favorite perfume notes. So smooth and romantic juice, Dark and and mysterious at the same time.<br/>\n",

So far, out of all the frags I’ve owned and tested, this is the only one (so far) I can say is perfect to me. I’m not the best at picking out various notes, and fairly new at exploring the huge varieties of scents out there, but La Nuit is absolutely incredible. It’s deep, DARK, and spicy... yet sweet, almost purely edible. A beautiful, warm, floral spiciness penetrates deep with this one, it smalls seductive, alluring, almost forbidden, as if derived from the gods. It smells slightly familiar, yet captivating and unique, a blend of exotic woods, spices, flowers, all brewed together and presented to you by a mythical creature of the forest, daring you to try it. It smells exotic yet natural, almost like some sort of undiscovered psychoactive substance, as strange as that sounds. I get hints of cinnamon, something edible, yet not fleeting/cloying. This fragrance is incredibly put together, and is possibly the greatest example of artistry in a perfume that I’ve come across so far. Absolutely divine, I have absolutely NOTHING bad to say about it. Some have complained about longevity, and I have no idea what they’re talking about as I sprayed it on my wrist a few hours ago and it has lost absolutely none of its potency, it’s only gotten deeper and more alluring. If I keep typing I’ll ramble and repeat myself, but to sum it up, this is absolute perfection in my eyes. <br/><br/>\n",

       "I recently tried on a sample of this after reading all the Hype &amp; Jeremy videos and here's my take.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Pros: Scent.<br/><br/>\n",
       "It's Heavenly. It's Sweet, Spicy &amp; Sexy with a hint of Dark. I think this is the perfect Date Scent. The Hype about this is real &amp; I loved every bit of it (at least for the short while it lasted).<br/><br/>\n",
       "Cons: Performance.<br/><br/>\n",
       "On Skin - The reviews don't lie. The Performance is really bad. It does not project more than an arm's length. And that lasts about 30 minutes to 1 hour, then it's a skin scent. And that also lasts around 2 hours. So total 3 hours of scent until this fades to 10% and then disappears. <br/><br/>\n",
       "On Clothes - Lasts about an hour more than on Skin, so make it 4 hours. I did not spray heavily though, just 2 sprays on the front to check it's performance. I get small whiffs of this after 4 hours but that's it.<br/><br/>\n",

I've been able to try MULTIPLE batches, all of which are authentic.  Each of them smells \"the same\" but some are darker juice color, some are lighter, and some don't last while others do. It isn't even always the darker juice that lasts longer either! Anyway, just my two cents, but I'm willing to bet some others out there agree, as I've seen some others complain about inconsistencies in juice color when they have multiple bottles. I've got a newer 2.0 oz bottle that performs extremely well, so I'm hanging on to it.</p>\n",

For some reason...it just completely disappears on my skin. It must be a reformulation or just my skin because I'm seeing reviews showing very good lasting power.

This is best suited for date nights and night outs when is very chilly outside, this is also a good versatile fragrance that I can see being dressed up and dressed down. This isn’t your childish bubble gumy Invictus so when dressed casually id recommend going with deep dark colors like black, dark grey, dark brown, navy blue, etc, you get the picture. In the opening you can instantly get lavender and bergamot that disapears and drys down into the sweet and spicy cardamom and cedarwood combo that we all know and love. This projects very nicely on my skin and has decent longevity but nothing over the top unfortunately, honestly this fragrance is a solid 9/10 ik it doesn’t have the best performance but still.</p>\n",

Even looking at the reviews I knew this was definitely something special once upon a time. Even he admits now that the reformulation has ruined this scent. I think YSL thought that they're getting enough attention with this one that they should water it down and try to maximise their margins. Regardless I thought I'll purchase it and maybe because I don't have any prior version to compare it to, I'll still like it. And I was right, such a beautiful scent, the opening is extremely fresh and the sweeter dry down is so scintillating. But this lasts about half an hour. The performance is TERRIBLE. It's actually abysmal, the drydown smell starts about 15mins into spraying and then after an hour you simply cannot smell this fragrance unless u put your whole nose on to skin. I actually returned my perfume after buying it, wasn't going to be happy having wasted my money on this rubbish. If only they bought back killer performance I'd buy it again otherwise it's totally not worth it.</p>\n",

It was a really solid release for the house of YSL, so I think it is not a coincidence the fact that it is so popular. I always liked this one from the very first time I tested it BUT to be quite honest it never blew my mind. I got countless testers from this one through the years - I even have 3 now which I use nowadays - but I never really thought of buying it. It is indeed a crowd pleaser, there is a lot of videos on youtube reviewing this one, highly praising it and creating all this hype that follows it for years.<br/><br/>\n",

       "Now I’ve never had the chance to smell the original 2009-2010 formulation but I’ve smelled a 2011 bottle, which was the first reformulation and 2011 is a richer, warmer, more potent and longer lasting than this one. I knew this when buying this new bottle, but I don’t feel like going on eBay and paying $200 or more for some strangers used bottle. It’s not worth it to me, especially since you just never know how that person has stored it. And least with buying brand new, you know what you’re buying. <br/><br/>\n",

Obviously it’s not like it was back in the day, but to my nose, it’s much better in terms of performance than the 2016 tester I tried. With my 2018 bottle, I got about 3 1/2 to 4 hours of about arms length projection that people around me could smell. I’ve read reviews from people saying they only got an hour and a half of projection from the 2016 reformulation and I honestly feel I only got about 2 hours from it as well, so I was pleasantly surprised when it was going on 4 hours and people a couple feet from me could still smell it. <br/><br/>\n",

       "<div class=\"revND\" style=\"background: #F5F4F8; position: relative;\"><p>This has to be my favorite fragrance of all time. I can speak to both pre-2014 and the newer formulations. I first smelled this in Macy's in 2013 when I first started college. Sprayed it on my wrist, and at first I wasn't crazy about it. As the day went on, I found myself sniffing my wrist constantly. I went back that same day and bought a bottle. After wearing one or two more times, I instantly fell in love with it. It is a very warm and inviting, spicy, yet slightly fresh scent all at the same time. Cardamom is one of my favorite fragrance notes, so I might be biased towards fragrances that have cardamom, but La nuit d'lhomme NAILS it. Ultra sexy fragrance. During my first year or two of college, girls would GUSH over this stuff. You would not believe some of the reactions I received from women, both young and old. This fragrance is actually how I met my girlfriend of almost 4 years. I technically met her through a mutual friend on a night out. But I noticed she kept following me around the bar we were at but had not spoken to me and after a while, she finally came up to me and said, \"You smell really really f'ing good and I need you to dance with me.\" True story. However, this is not everyone's cup of tea. It is definitely a bit metrosexual but still on the masculine side, so test before buying. But, I will never be without a bottle of this stuff in my rotation, old or new formulations.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Now as for the performance. While the bottle I had in 2013 was almost beast mode on my skin, the newer bottles are DEFINITELY lacking in the performance department. However, I believe the performance issues everyone is complaining about is a bit exaggerated. With the newer formulations I'm getting about 6 hours on my skin with moderate to slightly weak projection, which is fine since I wear this mostly for my gf and it became a scent to be worn more intimately for me. Buy a 200 ml bottle since they are cheap, get a decant and stick it in your pocket, and refill when needed. Problem solved. People need to stop worrying about reformulations and buy what you think smells good. All in all, one of my all time favorites that will always have a spot in my fragrance rotation.</p>\n",

I don't know the 2014 or prior formulations, although I had a decant from a tester bottle from a store a couple of months ago that smelled better and performed better. The 100 ml bottle (February 2018 batch) I recently bought however smells more synthetic to me (the ISO E Super is more obvious) and performance is abysmal. I now have 29 fragrances (well, 30 if I include my home fabricated Molecule 01 clone), some of them are rather weak performers, but my new La Nuit de l'Homme is the worst of them all. Instant skin scent. This is the first time I've bought a fragrance and feel like I've wasted my money. Such a shame, because I like the scent (even though I don't like it as much as the decant I had).</p>\n",

After almost 10 years I finally bought a bottle because it seems the youtube fragrance community has grown tremendously along with the popularity of this fragrance into \"hall of fame\" territory. Unfortunately this has been reformulated and watered down in performance and spices. Mostly warn as a sensual intimate close encounter night scent, great for dating or romantic dinners, its pretty much a sweet powdery lavender. Scent lasts 4-5 hrs on my skin, projection fades in under 1 hr but in a date-setting it gets the job done. Depending on how you are, this might come off too metro-sexual or young teen instead of those darker boozy spicier scents for night occasions. Overall this scent is currently overhyped and its still expensive for watered down juice, hope for better reformulation or atleast an actual \"intense\" version of this in an edp. <br/><br/>\n",

To my nose the 2016 reformulation smells a tad sweeter and not quite as powdery than pre 2016, but it still smells good. The main problem with post 2016 is the performance issues like everyone says. Everyone says it smells \"watered down\" and I agree. At first I thought it was because the European Union restricted certain ingredients to be used in fragrances, such as oak moss ect...but now I'm starting to think it's just YSL actually watering down their fragrance to save on cost. If you all Google \"la nuit de l'homme ingredients\" under google images, you\"ll see a picture of the back of a box from a 2011 batch with ingredients listing, \"ALCOHOL, PARFUM(FRAGRANCE), AQUA(WATER) and a 2016 batch listing, \"ALCOHOL, AQUA(WATER), PARFUM(FRAGRANCE).<br/><br/>\n",

IMHO it is way over-hyped and over-priced for what it is. Don't get me wrong, I like cardamom, like in cardamom tea or biscuits and, why not, also in fragrances. But it's a common ingredient in many perfumes. And it's a common ingredient in the kitchen, at least in my kitchen, and not comparable with precious oud or vetiver or ambergris or some hard-to-come-by resins. So, I don't get what the fuss is about, except for Jeremy Fragrance claiming that it's his \"most complimented\" fragrance. I find it kind of pleasant. But my GF, for example, doesn't like it much, it's too straightforwardly sweet for her (as a male perfume). If it works for you, great. But \"guys, trust me, this is THE ladykiller\" is a misleading overstatement while being pro bono marketing for YSL.</p>\n",

Let me begin this review by saying that this is a modern day masterpiece. Very lovely yet elegant mens fragrance. I get this lovely cardamon opening paired with a beautiful bergamot that dries down in to a gorgeous cedar wood, cardamon and lavender scent. I see people talk about performance issues or that it smells watered down. But, honestly I think this 2015 bottle smells very full and it last 8 plus hours as well as projects off of my skin for 3-4 hours. I absolutely love this fragrance one of my favorites in my collection and my absolute favorite spicy fragrance. I also love the slightly sweet nature to it. Gives this fragrance some real umph as well as this richness to the composition. Lastly, I would like to tell you guys that some women might actually think this is a women's fragrance when they smell it off of you.</p>\n",

Now when I first tested it back in 2016, I regretfully never looked up the batch code from the tester bottle, but I'm assuming it had to have been maybe 2015 or earlier because it was SO much better!

It was what it meant: a \"La Nuit\". It was a frag for date night that made the man irresistible in the woman's eyes, after a side-by-side romantic dinner, with candle light, fine wine and a box of Christopher Elbows chocolate for dessert...And then...It was totally fine if you wanted to skip...the candle light part :) Having said that, of course it takes more than just a great smell to impress your woman to \"agree\" with you.  <br/><br/>\n",

Because to me, it was more sophisticated than that. It was a \"tender lust\". There was something in those notes: cardamom, lavender, wood and vetiver...And for the bergamot, it just gently added freshness in the background. Again, because it was a La Nuit, not a \"parfum de jour\" :)<br/><br/>\n",
       "And that was the La Nuit De L'Homme I once knew when it just came out :( I can only embrace the memory of it now in my thought. There's is something unsatisfying with the new formula (could it be the lack of cinnamon, or amber, or a floral scent...??? I don't know, as I don't have the nose of an expert). It is still \"nice\", but not enough, in order to give me that tingling, sensational feeling that I experienced before. I know that I am missing something, since the last time I had a taste of this wonderful, luxurious fragrance! I will forever be haunted by that La Nuit De L'Homme!

I always snubbed this juice because whenever I would test it on paper it never really smelt of anything. I've given it a few proper skin tests now and it does open up into lovely well rounded scent. I'm not in love with this scent but will admit it is very nice. I bought a 2017 batch recently and compared to the bottles I've tested in other places it's not as good projection or performance wise. I get about 3-4 hours before it fades to a very light skin scent. Projection is better than most frags and it leaves a nice trail for the first hour or so it's applied. This was built to be a night scent but for me personally it's pretty versatile, I wouldn't say it's particularly a date scent either. I honestly think you can wear this for any occasion. Sexy, spicy, warm and alluring. I misjudged this one and I'm glad I realize that now. <br/><br/>\n",

       "You smell fragrance when your body heats up or when you put it in warm spots on your body (pulse points). <br/><br/>\n",
       "Spray fragrance about 10-15cm away from your skin to maximize the area, spray on the nape of your neck where your short hairs can act as a greater surface area and help diffuse scent; fragrance really grasps onto hair.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Exfoliate and moisturise your skin!!! Most men don’t do this. Men have drier skin and it soaks in fragrance like a sponge. You spray fragrance on dry skin, it disappears. Get a loofah for the shower, it helps a lot to exfoliate the dead skin. Use a non scented moisturizer or a complimentary body lotion to what you’re going to spray. <br/><br/>\n",
       "Don’t rub fragrance, dab it! When you rub it, you’re making it evaporate faster and making it sink deeper into your skin. You want it to stay on the top layer of your skin.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Have issue with projection and longevity? Use the complimentary body product to help layer. People see them as money grabs, but in reality, they’re meant to help with the scent lasting longer and project more, if that’s what you’re after; Shower gels, deodorants, aftershaves, etc. It’s not a money grab if it serves a purpose you want fulfilled.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Some people like discrete scents that are closer to their skin, so you can’t knock on something that doesn’t project if you don’t apply enough or doesn’t work for your skin. Looking at the fragrances you have, you can’t compare this scent to something like obsession or an oud based scent. It’s not comparative. Can’t expect a veggie salad to fill you like steak and potatoes.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Concentration means nothing, ingredients mean everything. People expect unicorns from their fragrances, wanting to spray it in the morning and have it last the rest of the week. A lot of people get used to the scent they’re wearing when it doesn’t have too much body in it. If you’re buying this fragrance to smell yourself and make others around you aware you’re wearing something, it’s not for you. You have to do up to 8-10 sprays if you want that effect, but it’s still not meant to be an offensive scent. <br/><br/>\n",
       "On my skin, this is heavy and cloying. The lavender is heavy and one spray for me last forever. I get around 8 hours of wear of this. Not saying this out of bias to say that people are wrong about lasting power, but it really depends from person to person. I prefer the original L’Homme over this and that lasts a long time on my skin as well, but I can’t stand LNDL’H.<br/><br/>\n",
       "You want something to last a long time? Go for a full bodied scent that has iris, woods, white florals, musks, patchouli, vanilla/amber, spices. <br/><br/>\n",
       "This is why fragrance experts in stores are important. Don’t blind buy a fragrance if you have problems with projection and longevity. I don’t allow people to buy something without trying it on if they’ve never tried it before. I legitimately refuse them. <br/><br/>\n",

I'd forgotten how this smells really (the bottle was bought in 2009 or '10) and the bottle is at 99% full.  Anyway, this is a classic for a reason.  It smells great, garners compliments, keeps a great scent cloud around you when it comes closer in and is just a great smelling classy, romantic, yet sophisticated fragrance.  It has good to great performance (sillage and lasting power).  This is cardamon and lavender done right with the rest of the notes being balanced so well.  I haven't smelled the new formulations of this particular scent.  I do have the flankers and like most of them, but nothing compares to this one within the series.

It's not a scent that screams to begin with but it is very soft, major lavender with a little sharp tang from the cardamom and bergamot. It stays this way for most of it's span with the cedar and vetiver playing into the original notes towards the end. It's quite powdery and woody, while retaining that lavender bomb feel, in this stage. So much so that I'm surprised there is no iris in it. I'm not entirely familiar with caraway but perhaps that's what gives this a unique edge. It smells like sex appeal and money. I can't argue with it's class, romanticism and sophistication. A modern dandy kind of a vibe. A euphemism of a masculine but sensitive and reserved lover, if you will.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Unfortunately, it's a little fleeting. I get about 3-6 hours with moderate projection. Nothing amazing on the performance end but the scent itself is absolute masterpiece. Inoffensive, sexy, somewhat dark but fresh. I could see this being my go to date frag if I was a single man. There's no age restrictions, time of day, season, nothing... It hits all those marks. It may be better suited to evening wear as the name implies but you could easily get away with it all day, every day and ooze sex appeal... If you're willing to constantly re-apply. Since it's such a bummer on that end, I'd suggest sampling first before making a dive (and purchasing through discounters) because it is likely it won't \"wow\" you in that regard. Without a shadow, the crying shame of my collection.</p>\n",

       "I dont really consider 2011,12,13,14  vintages TBH because it's not to me. It is the first reformulation<br/><br/>\n",
       "Before I purchased the 2010 batches, the closest thing I had was a 4 digit batch from 2011 but even though it had a 4 digit code 1BAB it was the first RE-formulation so having a 4 digit code didn't automatically mean you had the original. I say this because it has code BYB02-2, while original indicates BYB02-1<br/><br/>\n",

       "Yes I'm crazy for it like that German fellow (Jeremy) on YouTube lol. But it is my favorite scent of all time (even the newest I like very much)<br/><br/>\n",
       "Now I use a couple sprays of vintage (2010) and compliment it with 4 more sprays with any of 2011-2013 and it works reaaallly well. It will last me a life time since I'm using all of them sparingly and storing them in a dark cool environment.<br/><br/>\n",
       "For dates I won't use the 2010 because I'll be already in close quarters so no need and the other ones that I have get the job done for that kind of situation.<br/><br/>\n",

       "Original and first RE-formulation are really close. I find original just a touch darker in terms of smell, yes it lasts a bit longer than first reformulation and projection is more noticeable. You could wear the original version at a club and easily  get noticed with 5 good sprays. I don't club anymore though lol<br/><br/>\n",
       "Projection (2010 batch) I'm getting 4-5 hours of solid projection and on my skin for 12+ hour. (I don't have dry skin)<br/><br/>\n",
       "I've tested and studied this fragrance for a couple years now. New formulation performs at its best on clothing spray twice on the same spot on clothing<br/><br/>\n",

       "Add a few drops of water where you sprayed it (after 10 mins) and it boosts in projection. Not sure how that works but it does for me. <br/><br/>\n",
       "And I wear this fragrance year round no issues but much better if you wore the latest formulation in the summer since it's lighter juice or get the Frozen one.<br/><br/>\n",
       "FYI I have two LNDH Frozen as well and those actually perform better than first RE-formulation of LNDH so if you can still find those get it 4 hours of solid projection (about arms length) and 8-9 hours of longevity however, first RE-formulation has better longevity than frozen. I get 3 hours of projection with 2011,12,13 LNDH<br/><br/>\n",
       "I might pick up the Zara's interpretation of this fragrance just to see how it is.<br/><br/>\n",
       "2011 to 2015 is the same thing which is first reformulation. So 2012/2014 etc all same thing. 2012 is not stronger than 2014 or 2015 is not worse than 2011 like many say. <br/>\n",
       "I used to feel that way but the code BYB02-2 doesn't lie, you can find that at the back and that is the ingredient code basically. One being stronger than others throughout this period could be a psychological thing. If you see ingredient code C1 and/or you see Arabic writing on the back of the box you have 2016  - present.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Having said that, there is no denying over those years (2011-2015) the juices' colors and bottles are bit different but the formula still the same.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Compliments are high but the reason why is because it suits me and my persona (dark unpredictable mysterious appearance lol). And yes it smells good of course. When I asked a few girls what you like about it, a few of them said \"I think it suits you or you smell very unique and different\" and like I said it does when it mixes with my skin chemistry! <br/><br/>\n",
       "It is not my most complimented fragrance but when I get a compliment on this one it's over the top reaction. My top 5 complimented fragrance for sure (invictus aqua, prada l'homme, rasasi, CAHSEE are my other ones)<br/><br/>\n",
       "On a side note, if you wear fragrances that suits you, it compliments you as a person and you will receive compliments.<br/><br/><br/>\n",
       "It's a shame what they have done to the original but me personally I can finally rest with my LNDH 2009-2010 vintage hunt.</p>\n",

Some times you buy stuff to impress women and sometimes you buy stuff because you (yourself) like it.<br/><br/>\n",

I wore it for about 3 weeks and never got any type of commentary on it. This is strange because one of the reasons I bought this cologne was because it was on several \"sexiest frags\" lists and yet I didn't get the compliments that all these other people are saying they get.<br/><br/>\n",

       "This is a gorgeous concotion. The cardamom is sweet and creamy, very prominent from start to finish. The second most identifiable note is the bergamot, followed closely by the lavender.

       "BUT.<br/><br/>\n",
       "What everyone has been saying in all of the reviews below is absolutely true concerning the longevity. My bottle is from January of 2017, and while I haven't had the pleasure of trying any previous versions, what I do know is that this particular version evaporates in less than two hours. (The stuff I sprayed on a tester card at the mall lasted longer than this, so maybe it's true that tester bottles are older formulations, or purposefully made with stronger formulas.)<br/><br/>\n",
       "It's not a strong, overpowering scent to begin with, and that's fine, but even with more tame fragrances, I expect them to stick around for at least four hours. I don't mind having to re-apply a really beautiful scent halfway through the day. I do mind having to re-apply a fragrance four or five times per day, which is what I've had to do with this current version, and that's not acceptable -- especially at this price.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Here's hoping future versions have better longevity, because this truly is a very, very good fragrance.<br/><br/>\n",
       "(Final note about longevity: it's been three hours since I applied Nuit de l'Homme to my skin. I have a scent card sitting two feet away that I sprayed YLS's Opium on about eight hours ago. I can smell the Opium on the card more clearly than I can smell the Nuit on my own skin. That's ridiculous.)</p>\n",

Most of the time, testers in store are old bottles with deeper smell and better longevity. I found that most of the time when you buy, you will not get the same juice as the one you tested. Look at the batch number printed under the tester bottle or embossed on the bottom of the box and go at checkfresh.com to check the date of manufacture. This way you will know what you get. 2015 and above is watered down. Dont get me wrong, the LaNuit dna is still there but you get lighter alcohol smelling diluted juice.

I didn’t like this when I first smelt it on a tester card or even when sniffing it off the neck of the bottle. I just didn’t get the big deal. I’m the same with D&amp;G The One, even though I got it anyway! But, I gave it another go based on so many people talking about it on YouTube; many who I respect and know their juices. Well, I’m glad I did.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Originality: 3 out of 5 – This is different, but I feel like I’ve smelt something similar to it before. I just can’t remember what it was.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Projection (Sillage): 4 out of 5 – heavy; People can smell you coming. I used one spray to each side of the neck; this is appropriate.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Versatility: 4 out of 5 – This scent is very versatile; it works well for day/night AND autumn/winter AND dressed-up/formal occasions, for men over 25.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Value: 3.5 out of 5 – just under £60 for 100ml is the going rate for a fragrance of this quality from a designer brand. If it’s on sale, great!<br/><br/>\n",
       "Compliment Frequency: 5 out of 5 – I went to the bank within minutes of spraying this. The cashier said ‘OMG, you smell great, what is that?.’ She continued chatting and we ended up speaking for 5 minutes about fragrances before anything else. She mentioned she also loves what her manager wears - ‘Creed’. I asked which one but she didn’t know. Before everyone yawns, I bet we’d all take a bet at Aventus right? Regardless, this got a reaction I didn’t expect and within minutes. It also turned heads; I caught one woman doing a top-to-bottom ‘scanning with her eyes’ behind me at Tesco! So, if you’re after all of this, this fragrance will leave you feeling higher than a giraffes genitals!<br/><br/>\n",
       "Packaging (Bottling): 3 out of 5 – The bottle and sprayer are functional, but nothing special, aesthetically.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Overall Rating: 4 out of 5 – Great – This fragrance does just about everything you could ever want from a fragrance of its type (meaning it’s good enough for a lack of originality and plush bottling to ignore). There aren’t any significant problems with the fragrance, but you are not left in complete awe, either.<br/><br/>\n",

       "Scent: 8/10<br/>\n",
       "I would consider it a general crowd pleaser...not amazing, not ground-breaking, fragrance enthusiasts would probably find it ''boring''(dry down does not differ a great deal from the opening) however I think it is overall very nice. The best way to describe it is a ''sexy'' pleasant and classy, sweet lavender with a very faint but noticeable powdery touch. To me Lavender is the most prominent note in this<br/><br/>\n",

       "Sillage/Projection: 6/10<br/>\n",
       "Each time I wore this I would apply a total of 9 sprays. 2 at each side of the neck, 4 at the front base of my neck and 1 at the back of my neck. for the first 2 hours this projected surprisingly well to what I expected based on the reviews I have read.<br/>\n",
       "As I was walking down the hallway at school I could smell the scent rising and projecting. roughly at no more than arms length. Sadly though after about 2-3 hours this was a skin scent.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Weather:<br/>\n",
       "Autumn(Fall) and Winter<br/><br/>\n",
       "Who could wear this?:<br/>\n",
       "I personally think it can be worn by anyone who is well dressed, as the scent does have a classy/formal vibe. as for age?, I think the ''perfect'' age to wear this would be mid twenties. Although as I said above can be worn by anyone who is well dressed... I myself wore this at school and with the smart looking uniform it worked really well.

If you're here looking for the fragrance that people talked about on Youtube... then you will be disappointed because that frag no longer exists. The now version is so different from what La Nuit was that fakes smell more like the real thing than the actual version that is available now. YSL is ripping you off by selling a lie.<br/><br/>\n",

I cannot speak for the original formulation since I have a 2013 batch. I still love this fragrance though. I will tell you that I blind bough this fragrance in 2013 after seeing Jeremy fragrances review. He called this the best fragrance ever. I disagree. This was a very good fragrance that has been beaten to death by reformulation. <br/><br/>\n",
       "The scent starts of fresh and spicy initially and completely changes later on. If you ever seen a Youtuber spray this on a test strip for a woman, then have her give an opinion it, don't waste your time listening. The opening of this fragrance is okay, nothing special while dry down is magical. You will be blown away by how good you smell. The dry down it is sweet and powdery making it smell unisex. Many women loves this smell since it is not overly masculine and smells very subtle.<br/><br/>\n",
       "This fragrance is meant to be worn in cool weather at night but it’s so much more versatile than that. You can wear it to work or casually on a cold day through spring, fall and winter. Do not wear this for outdoor events or clubbing. This is a close encounter fragrance that was designed for intimate seduction.<br/><br/>\n",
       "This fragrance has a weak projection. People have to super close to smell this. Don't fall for the \"2016 batch has doesn't project hype\". The early batches don't do all that well either. Now the longevity on this batch though is 6-8 hours so that where this beats the newer ones. Funny thing is this gives me decent silage. People compliment when I'm leaving rather when I'm just around them. Weird I know.<br/><br/>\n",
       "When buying this I thought it was going to get me laid and be a super compliment monster (I was young and in college). This taught me that there is no such thing as a panty dropper fragrance. People who do smell it will compliment you though and no one will ever say you smell bad. <br/><br/>\n",
       "DO NOT BUY AN EXPENSIVE OLDER BATCH OF THIS. It's not worth it. I've seen bottles of this go for $180 on EBay. Don't do it. Move on to something. Even Jeremy Fragrance has moved on. This was a successful blind buy due to him but now my bottle is ending. I will not be buying another.

I am an average looking guy so I will appreciate anything that makes me more attractive, and this works better than any other designer or niche scent I own. People go for the creeds and tom fords but for me this is the only king. Emotion and memory is strongly linked to olfactory senses, and this triggers something powerful. Almost every woman I have asked LOVE this one. I do advise you search for the older bottles as the new ones are a joke unfortunately. It will be expensive but worth every penny.</p>\n",

They will buy it ten years in a row and don’t notice the weaker performance because the invest no thoughts about their scent. But to me it’s a disaster what they did to this scent. It’s the reason why I will never buy it again. Maybe it’s part of the game that heroes like this scent will disappear and make space for new stars. The scent is like Mike Tyson. He can’t box anymore, but he is still famous and will be in the media as a comedian or an actor. But as a boxer he can’t compete anymore!</p>\n",

YSL watered down La nuit de L'Homme because I see the juice color gets lighter. Learn some chemistry people. It's just artificially color. The 2016 is still good as hell, not to say it may be better because there's less artificially color in it. Do yourself a favor. Whenever there's an ongoing discussion about reformulation, please steer clear from it because you will be wasting your time just like me. I tried and tried to find an earlier version of La nuit for what? The same thing with a higher price. The original La nuit was never a powerhouse. The newer version may be weaker in the slightest but what? Go to a store. Smell it. Love it. Buy it. It's that simple. Fragrantica is a very useful site, but some Fragranticans just make things so much more complicated than they should be.</p>\n",

Females flippin' love this. It's addicting, sexy, comforting, masculine, cozy, safe. Their words.<br/><br/>\n",

Synthetic, generic, alcoholy Axe deo spray. Not gross, but far from pleasing and/or sophisticated in any shape or form. If I'd smell this without knowing the dry down on skin and/or how a majority of females react to this I'd press charges on YSL for selling this scent for the price they demand. However, knowing the dry down, and also what the scent does to me and females smelling it on me... makes me want to stock up on more bottles. So you can see that there's two very opposite edges to this sword. To further complicate things, the projection is non-existing and the longevity is borderline okay at best. It's a very skin tight scent with absolutely no sillage - so you, or the one you want smelling it, need to get really close to notice it. But once you/they do, lord have mercy.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Takes a few uses to find how many sprays you need, I would suggest experimenting with that in solitary before taking it onto the field. Woody cardamom in the foreground and lavender dressed in sexy bergamot in the background. Personally think it works year around but I can see how some would find it a bit deep for summers. This fragrance is very hard to rate by numbers since the valleys are so steep and the hilltops are so high. Taken out of its context, it's nothing - let it transform in symbiosis with you and it's everything. <br/><br/>\n",

       "Yes it is disappointing. It is pure shit now, scented water. If you only tried 2014 and earlier versions, you would know why it was popular. It had magic like no other frag. Sadly 2 years ago it lost it. The smell changed a lot and it is watered down into oblivion. So now it is nothing special. I would really love to see this discontinued because ppl are being mislead into buying this dead and destroyed frag because of the hype and popularity it once had. It was the king of kings in the fragrance world. Sad to see this one go to the beggar level who now only lives because of it's former glory. They should label this La Nuit 2017 or something because ppl like you go into the stores and buy this and get nothing like all the people are telling... because the magic is gone and the magic is what sold this big time. This should cost like 20 bucks, because Zara has much better frags that smell similar and last way longer. But of course YSL keeps the old high prices. Fuck em, honestly!! Will not be buying anything from them because of this.</p>\n",

They smell to me very close to 2009-2010 batches.  Only difference I find is that the 2013 bottles are missing some certain note, which I don't know what it is.  Anyway it's a kind of earthy dark very pleasant smell, it surely is present in 2009-2010 batches but not anymore 2011-current batches.<br/>\n",

Make no mistake, this is a 10/10 fragrance. At least... it used to be. And this is why I've held off on reviewing this one. <br/><br/>\n",
       "As everybody and their dog is already aware by now, it's been reformulated to perfume hell. While other fragrances usually get a reformulation few and far between, La Nuit has been violated over, and over, and over again by Yves Saint L'Oreal with no shame. This garbage is now bottled water at full designer price, again wit no shame. Newest reformulation (are we even keeping count anymore..?) lasts 1-2 hours on my skin and I've basically given up on it. Don't bother. Keep an eye out for whether or not we get any 2017 reformulations for the  better, as by this point everyone is tired of L'Oreals shit and has stopped buying this, or removed this from their most worn scents. <br/><br/>\n",
       "The 2009-2014 scents are soft, sensual, heavenly cardamom flowery woody goodness that make women melt. This is one of THE best scents to impress women. Nobody even cares how common and popular it is because it just smells so damn good. It is my #1 scent for making an impression to women and it has never let me down. Ever. Honestly, this makes me melt too. This will make you want to have sex with yourself just by smelling it. I think this is a manly fragrance that works on men the best. However, if a woman wore this scent, I'd want to eat her up, it'd be so attractive. It's just so good. <br/><br/>\n",
       "Longevity of my 2014 bottle is about 6 hours, with 2 hours or so of projection. Not as good as 2009, but still is fine in my book. Really, anything that lasts at least 6 hours is acceptable to me. On my skin, I can still smell a faint skin scent at the 10 hour mark, but it mostly does die away at the 6 hour mark for me. Pretty damn impressive. <br/>\n",
       "2009 bottle I've since finished long ago and it was easily 10 hours on my skin, with 4 hours of projection and I've forgotten when it died down because I usually went to bed. The next day I'd still smell it faintly...<br/><br/>\n",
       "So, 2014 and forward? Ranging from perfume water to bottled water with some of the worst longevity, altered, boring, extremely weak smell. Lasts 1-2 hours max, you can barely smell it. Enough said. It's trash. And it makes me really upset. If you've never smelled the originals, or even the 2014 version which is still weaker than the 2009, you may probably still like the newest reformulations smell. But after you smell the original vintage, you'll hate the new one for how weak it is. Your mileage may very.<br/><br/>\n",
       "All in all, this was my go to scent for just about everything way back when. Thanks to the IFRA and the greed of Yves saint L'Oreal, it's now a mass marketed, money grabbing product instead of a piece of art. Just riding the coattails of the hype it got so many years back in order to milk whatever money it can from young men who read stellar reviews about what it once was. That's really all I have to say, it's watered down garbage now. It used to be legendary, but I guess all legends fade into history at some point in time. <br/><br/>\n",

       "2015+<br/>\n",
       "2/10 across the board, mostly due to me being bitter. The bottled water you spray still has a smell that resembles the La Nuit, so I guess it's still worth checking out to those who've never smelled this before.</p>\n",

It was the bomb in those days, something different from Bleu de Chanel, L'Instant d'Guerlain Intense, Dior Homme Intense, One Million or A Men, if anyone remembers any of these. Yes, underdog is the word for it. The best bet for any unassuming young man wanting to compete with the big guys. Dominique Ropion is a genius, but I wouldn't have paid any attention or become such a fan of him if I did not come across La Nuit. Fast forward to today, it's finally getting the recognition it deserves (no. 1 on Fragrantica!), but it seems to have been reformulated. Now, this is really sad news. It had so much potential to be a world-beater. But it got stopped in its tracks it seems. I wish I'd got a bottle of it way back then.</p>\n",

You can't have an ongoing rating system for fragrances indefinitely... Its giving people inaccurate information.  This rating system should be given in certain intervals, maybe every 2-3 years... could also have a history tab for previous ratings and/or an overall rating score for the fragrances history.  Anyone who buys this fragrances going over the rating on performance will be disappointed.  When I tried this at the mall a couple of years ago the performance was horrid.  After an hour I barely smelled it on me.. I even asked other people and they could barely smell it.   This is one of the most over hyped fragrances of all time.

In fact many have told me it smelled feminine.  Even the vintage formulation was far from a beastly performer.. This was always a more mild type of scent.   The newer formulation I tried was just piss water.. Im not complaining cause i didn't get 12 hours and monster projection.</p>\n",

It's modern with the inclusion of the sweet coumarin (although not listed in the notes here, it is elsewhere) and yet it's classic with its use of lavender and vetiver. This is a fragrance that can be used on any occasion - formal or casual, and it's bound to get you compliments.<br/><br/>\n",
       "There is a lot that has already been said about how the fragrance smells, so I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>\n",
       "However, my two cents to would be that YES, the various formulations of this one matter a lot. I've had one bottle that lasted me all day 8 am to 6 pm (with slightly expected degradation - of course) to another bottle that lasts me 4 hours and needs a touch up in the afternoon. With that being said, you'll never really know. If you're looking for a vintage bottle, don't bother wasting your time and just buy the new version. It still smells amazing, just doesn't have the longevity this was KNOWN for (key point there). It  does not mean that it's not an amazing fragrance just because it doesn't last as long (or project as much) as it once did before. If you're curious about it, try it. It's so popular that you're more likely to enjoy it than dislike it.</p>\n",

It smelled like winter and Christmas to me. Unfortunately though, like many people have said, the performance was awful! It lasted no more than 2 hours on my skin. I can't justify buying a full bottle of this stuff and blowing through it in a few months because it doesn't perform. I'm not sure what batch that was but I doubt it was a vintage batch.

It's an alluring scent, in the office I notice how my lovely female colleagues seem to come weirdly close to me and some of them have told me I smell good.

When I got myself a 2015 bottle (62M403) I noticed that something was a bit off compared to the sample, it had an alcohol smell in the opening that my sample didn't have and the smooth cardamon note was toned down and it smelled a little bit sharper. I did some research and found out about the reformulations and have since gotten my hands on a 2013 bottle (38K900) with the darker juice color. When I smelled it I was like \"Yes, this is what that old sample smelled like!\"<br/><br/>\n",

       "It lasts 8hrs + on my skin but it sits close to the skin. If you want it to radiate, you would probably have to spray about 6-8 sprays depending on your skin. I spray 6 and it doesn't project that great, only if the person is really close, which isn't a bad thing I guess if the person you want is going to be close to you, but not good if you want it to project.<br/><br/>\n",
       "It can be worn day/night and any time of the year. Its not too loud that it can't be worn during the day and it's not too cloying that it can't be worn during summer. It is quite a flexible fragrance; sure it may dry down to a sweet, creamy and seductive scent but it's not too harsh that it is inappropriate, it is light but noticeable which in my opinion makes it okay to wear anywhere. All that really matters thought is that you're confident and happy wearing it.</p>\n",

La Nuit isn't as bubblegummy as 1 million or Profumo, but now it has a little bit of that vibe. I would say vanilla-lavender is it's strongest note now.</p>\n",

Now I'm no fragrance conoissieur, but instead of bashing this fragrance, does anyone have any idea in tips and tricks to improve the projection and longevity of this thing? perhaps apply the YSL LNDL deodorant spray or the aftershave balm and then apply this? I think we should experiment in how to improve the performance than to bash it. It's a fact, that people who like it, will like it and no hate on it will change their minds. What frustrates people, is the performance. Let's all try and help each other out!</p>\n",

The dry down is a hint of powdery and sweet but it becomes more spicy. It is absolutely amazing. I was a little concerned about performance by reading some of these reviews but I am glad I went ahead and got it. It projects very well and the longevity is very strong. I can get a whole 8 hour work day out of it .It still smells like I just sprayed it 4 hours later except the top notes have moved on to the middle notes so it is less powdery. It is going strong. Probably best performer in my collection. I got the gift set which includes the shower gel which is pretty good as well. This is no where near boring or basic. Batch 38N103- January 2016.</p>\n",

       "Spray 2 times in the chest and 1 time in the back of the neck with DHI, put on a shirt or whatever; after 30-40 min before you leave home put 2 sprays on the neck, 2 on clothes and 1 on each wrist of La Nuit and i'm telling you that the results are amaaaazing.<br/><br/>\n",
       "The opening of DHI can be to some a little too feminine but after it dries down you are gonna get this beautiful, alluring and sophisticated coco/chocolate/lavender scent that combined with the cardamom and lavender of the opening of La Nuit, makes for an incredible delicious scent.But the best part comes when both La Nuit and DHI dry downs combine together OMG!!!!!! is almost indescribable, you have to try it by yourselves because the power of DHI combines to perfection with the smoothness and subtle scent of La Nuit, and if you have a decan I suggest you overspray every 2 hours on you neck with La Nuit to refresh the mix.<br/><br/>\n",
       "I wonder why nobody (or at least I haven't heard or read about it) has put this 2 together; they both have a metrosexual vibe going on, they both have a strong lavender note and the both have the most alluring dry downs on the market. <br/><br/>\n",

I really can't say much other than this is a true masterpiece of a fragrance, it provides something unique, a certain sensual yet ecstatic vibe to an individual. I actually first tried this fragrance out on the advice of a Youtuber, and I don't regret it. This was the first fragrance where for the first time I actually closed my eyes in enjoyment when I smelled this. It has a strong sweetness to it accompanied by a warm flush of spice that goes hand in hand with an even sweeter dry down. Performance wise, it's nothing to write home about, I get a decent 6-8 hours on it but I'm sure that the reformulation didn't help in regards to its performance. However it does sort of counteract this performance with a relatively strong projection and a decent sillage. I have met some people that dislike this fragrance and attribute it to a potpourri smell, and I've had people that have given me extravagant compliments. This a fragrance worth getting, no doubt about it, its price isn't going to decimate your wallet and it's an experience that needs to be witnessed first hand. I hope that this review has helped some of you with any doubts or thoughts on this fragrance, this review is not the be all and end all but I strongly recommend this scent. Good luck with the brilliant La Nuit! I'd give it a solid 10/10 :)</p>\n",

Now, it's not even the shadow of what it once was. I have 200 ml bottle from 2014 and it does the job well. Tried 2015 and horrendous 2016. At this price? It's a joke and an insult. It is dead to me because my axe can match it.<br/><br/>\n",
       "This should cost max $20. It lasts 2 hours and projects 45 mins, maybe. And that isn't the worst thing. The smell alone has changed. They watered it down to the max!!! Low silage, low lasting power, low everything. Sweat opening... gone. Dry down kicks in really quick but goes away quickly too and within 2 to max 3 hours it is gone. Zara fragrances preform better. Many of them. Once, people joked about The One EDP for it's shitty lasting power. Now The One EDP compared to this shit lasts amazingly good.<br/><br/>\n",
       "I wanted to buy another few bottles but no way. I am using ADG Profumo, The One and Spicebomb and Ch Men. Every one of those are more potent more powerful than this one. I was so so sad to smell the new reform and with a VERY EXTREMELY heavy heart I decided to drop it. What it meant for me... for the girls, even my girl now... it's gone. Even 2014 formulation I got 8 hours, very strong sweet opening with a beautiful woody dry down which girls simply loved and could smell hours after I applied it.<br/><br/>\n",
       "I was out with two girls and I put like 20 sprays if not even more in the store. Literary 40 mins later, I asked, do you smell anything? They said no. It was so close to the skin I barely could feel it myself.<br/><br/>\n",
       "So yeah, RIP La Nuit. To give so much money in it's current state is a rip off. I really hope the sales decline and that they hear us so they change it back to what it once was. So yeah I am very disappointed and I have changed my signature to something else. I really hope YSL will see this, because many guys share the same opinion.<br/><br/>\n",

Event he one EDT lasts 8+ hours and this shit can't break 3. And I am not the only one saying so. Why I would like for this to get discontinued... because it's not the same fragrance anymore, smell wise. If they can't change that... well then sorry. And don't put everything on IFRA. If this stayed as 2014 it would have barely be given a pass but it would pass. They keep watering it down because it's popular and sheeple will buy regardless. Good luck to them, there are many many frags that do the same or better in the sea of fragrances out there.</p>\n",

       "<div class=\"revND\" style=\"background: #F5F4F8; position: relative;\"><p>I've been wondering about this one for some time now.  I sniffed it once and then wore it a couple of times when testing a couple of perfumes when just having a look/sniff around.  The sales assistant at the shop knows his stuff (it's an independent business which has been going for over a century) and this was one of the two he suggested I try.  I did and thought it was lovely.  It stayed in my mind for some time and so when I noticed that people were beginning to complain about reformulations, I thought I would get hold of a pre-2015 batch, a classic original batch, if you will.  I notice that the pre-2015 versions (which I've not tried, I admit) are going for progressively sillier prices on ebay and similar places.  So I decided it was now or never and I took the plunge and bought a 2014 batch, for about 35ml for £28.  <br/><br/>\n",
       "I'm glad I did.  It's nice.  I like it.  But - and whisper this quietly - I don't think that it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  I don't think that it is a great perfume.  It's good, but not great, not worth silly prices.  It's rather sweet and projects heavily at first with the sweetness of the bergamot and cardamom blasting away along with the caraway giving it a certain sharpness.  But it soon settles down and improves with a little time.  It improves as the lavender, cedar and vetiver replace the bergamot and the cardamom settles down.  The scent lasts for around 10 hours or so so you certainly got your money's worth for durability in the old one.  Again, I repeat, I haven't tried the 2015 or 2016 versions so I can't give you a comparison but I'm prepared to believe those who say it has only a fraction of the power of the original because the juice is a much paler colour so you can visibly see that it's been reformulated and that it wasn't just a rogue batch or two.  <br/><br/>\n",
       "Will I buy a 2015 or 2016 reformulation?  No.  Will I buy a 2014 or earlier batch again.  No.  Would I be disappointed if someone bought me a bottle of the classic for a present?  No, I'd be moderately pleased.  <br/><br/>\n",
       "This is nice and if you like sweet woody spicy fragrances then I recommend it highly to you.  But for me?  Well, I've got a list of discontinued perfumes that I want a lot more than this that require paying progressively higher prices so I don't think I'll be after a top up unless they change it back to something much closer to the original.</p>\n",

This should get a separate version page on here, like la nuit 2015, because... this simply isn't the same smell and let's not even talk about longevity. Sad thing to see it go. Wanted to re buy but will change my signature to something else.</p>\n",

       "I bought it july 2016 first time already after I found out all about different formulations, and it was 2013 batch.<br/><br/>\n",
       "For those who still don't have it and is reading/watching reviews and want to try it:<br/>\n",
       "In my opinion, it's a great scent, seriously(was great at least,until 2015 reformulation). Yes, of course it's sweet like any evening stuff and what did you expected? But for me it's not that tipe of powerfull or enormous sweetness.It's pleasant, it's calm. It's a refined sweetness. For me even Mugler's A'Men is refined. It's more sweet and I love it! Guerlain's LIDGE is more sweet and I love it. That's why comparing to them I think that La Nuit is not that sweet. It's inoffencive, once again IMO.<br/>\n",
       "Does it deserve of all the hype around? I don't know, I think - No. But is it good ? - Definitely! Moreover - it's a very very good scent ! So if you like sweet stuff, you won't regret buying this. <br/>\n",
       "BUT !<br/>\n",
       "Only buying the older formulation. <br/>\n",
       "Yes, the 2015 one is not a trainwreck if you didn't try earlier ones. Scent is good, only longevity sucks. Especially sucks for who has a dry skin which doesn't hold fragrances. I'm that one so the question of longevity is very important for me.<br/>\n",
       "People are saying that 2016 batch is even worse than 2015 So I do not recommend to buy them. Because there are other better options I guess. At least same D&amp;G - The one EDP. It's a very good scent, amazing, and girls also love it. And it's nice in terms of money. <br/><br/>\n",
       "But if you really wanna try \"La nuit\" I recommend you to search for 2012-2014 batches. <br/>\n",
       "Don't pay insane amounts of money for earlier versions. Theyre better, It's true. I've smelled original 2009 formulation, and I can say that it's simply deeper. It has richer scent especially at the beginning, in opening (compared with my 2013 version). First 30 minutes you can clearly feel this difference, then both are same for about 1-1.5 hour and after that 2013 version goes like - \"volume\" down. So the 2009 version has like a +1 hour of good longevity on my skin. But I think it's not worth of paying  three or four times more for 2009-2011 batches.<br/><br/>\n",
       "If you want to try still good \"La Nuit\" in a golden middle - look for 2012-2014 as I said. I have 3-4 hours of good longevity before it will become skin scent with my 2013 version. And for those who has a better skin it will be even longer, 5-6 hours. So it's very nice.   <br/><br/>\n",
       "So, like a conclusion.<br/>\n",
       "I love the scent and it really deserves good words about it! I don't say that using it girls will literally fall near you, it's not a magic pill :) But they will like it!<br/><br/>\n",
       "So first try to smell it somewhere to test if you generally like it. And if you decide that you like it - go for it!<br/>\n",
       "Hope my opinions will help someone :)</p>\n",

Well, my reaction was obvious because when you own 2009 formulation for years and try something which is a fake, its gonna break your heart. <br/><br/>\n",
       "So I tested the 2015 version and finally bought a new bottle. A lot is being discussed on YSL reformulation so I thought of coming here again and give my honest opinion. So my testing so far reveals that - new 2015 juice is a bit lighter greenish in color, the old one was  a bit dark greenish in composition. The opening with prominent cardamom is not there but there is some hint, I guess they tried getting that smell with some other materials but I am not able to understand what it is. I wont get into notes, you all know it but believe me it is still very near to the original, less that cardamom tinge. One more observation, people claim to have monster projection and longevity, believe me guys it was never monstrous in original as well. It is a great creation, those who owned the original know what I mean. It worked great in close proximity, stayed for at least a day on fabrics when sprayed. Amazing experience which is hard to explain. My new bottle gives almost 2 hours of projection which is same as I used to get with 2009 bottles. It becomes close to your skin but stays there for hours the way it used to linger on old ! The longevity on skin was anywhere between 7 to 10 hours depending on your application, now I am getting around 7 to 8 hours consistently. My colleagues asked me many a times in this short testing as to what I was wearing. So my testing concludes, if you never tried the old formulation, you will still love it. If you know the old, you might not appreciate as the new ones are missing cardamom. But if you loved it and want to keep coming back to monsieur Yves, please do so. It is still a great possession guys. <br/><br/>\n",

This cologne, like everything I've smelled from YSL, is unbearable. Some scents are more and less pleasing to me, but this actually induces a headache.  At first I thought I might have been overwhelmed by smelling so many new fragrances in the store, and based on the positive reviews, I sprayed some of this on my skin instead of on a card.  2 hours later, every wiff I got of it made my headache worse.  Even after scrubbing, this haunted me until I showered the following morning.  My girlfriend also HATED it.  Maybe its just my body chemistry, but this seems like a polarizing scent.  Based on the reviews, many people love it, but I assure you, there are also many people who will leave the room when you enter because its so cloying.  Seriously overwhelming, chemy smell.<br/><br/>\n",

When I wear this fragrance it makes me feel sexy. It's a compliment-getter indeed. It is a bit powdery. It has the DNA of the original Lhomme in the background but very minor which made me think this could be a stand alone fragrance rather than a flanker. All in all, this smells rich, complex and sophisticated. Very suitable for evening wear like dates and special occasions, dressed up or dressed down. Many said that the reformulation had watered down its longevity. But when I wear this one, I can still smell it the next day. Because of that I'm pretty satisfied with its performance. <br/><br/>\n",

The reformulation did change it up and yes it lasts much less than it used too, just get a small travel size and reapply ever 3 or 4 hours and you will be as sexy as you can be.

I have a very neutral body chemistry, so fragrances tend to smell true on me and I can usually get the expected 4-6 hours of detectability out of a toilette. This fragrance is in a whole other league. I only use one spray to my chest, and that is plenty. The first 1-3 hours the silage is very intense. It will enter the room before you do. Because of this I'm careful wearing it around people who might not like the scent when I first put it on, because it could easily knock someone out. The next 4-6 hours still have a powerful silage, though within arms length and more what you would expect from a fragrance. 6+ hours I still get wafts of it on myself, but it's less noticeable to others.<br/><br/>\n",
       "The scent itself is DIVINE. Absolute heaven. Cozy, warm, aromatic. On me it smells like rich cardamom mixed with fresh lavender and hint of deep woodsy notes underneath. Because it's such a relaxing and strong fragrance I'll usually put it on before bed to help me calm down, and since I'm alone it won't accidentally offend anyone around. After applying it at night, I can still smell it on my pajamas the next morning. Seriously this stuff lasts and lasts. I can't imagine anyone not liking the smell, but I did get a complaint from someone sitting next to me at a sporting event once (perhaps because of the strength rather than the notes themselves?).</p>\n",

I am surprised that there is still no clone for this not even from Armaf, Ajmal, Lattafa or Al Haramain houses from Dubai. Armaf killed Blue de Chanel I hope they do the same with YSL. If, guys, there exists some clone that is still hidden from me please post it here. Lastly, even if the performance of this stuff is bad do buy it nonetheless as it is still a great date scent.

I had a long obsession with fragrances, but hit a long dry spell by 2013 after becoming bored with the current offerings until my passion for fragrance was reignited by this masterpiece. I loved it so much that I bought the biggest bottle possible. When I first bought it I was in love and used it daily for over a year, but then felt the need to take a break from it of it and stopped using it since then. I am left with roughly 45% of a bottle left and rarely use it, especially finding out how it has been butchered by reformulation. The 2011 that I have is pungent and has great longevity on even my fragrance guzzling skin. It's full of spice, lavender, incense, herbal notes on a base of creamy wood. It's so soothing on rainy days and received loads of compliments with its radiant sillage and everlasting longevity.<br/><br/>\n",
       "I decided to try my bottle vs a reformulated bottle to see if it was really as bad as people claim, and unfortunately the reformulation is tragic. The reformulation is recognizable, but so weak and missing the richness and depth of the 2011. It's like comparing skim milk to cream.. they're both dairy, but one has substance, depth, richness, while one feels watery, weak and boring. The 2011 has this really pungent, aromatic fullness to it that just uplifts and fills you up with contentment, but the new version doesn't move me at all. This should be renamed La Tragédie de l'Homme. <br/><br/>\n",

The base is deep and rich with cumin and vetiver. Compared to L'Homme this one seems to be the real attention getter from everyone who gets a whiff of it.

You can wear this during the afternoon and it will still be there. Not as strong of course, but still has a great smell. So if you want it for an evening I would wait before throwing this cologne on. It's overall an attention grabber. So for those who enjoy standing out of the crowd. Definitely pick one up if you get the chance.<br/><br/>\n",

This is not a review just the craziest compliment I ever got on my Cologne. So if you are under 18 please stop reading now. Okay I got this juice based on so many TopTenREVIEWS on YouTube so I had to add it to my collection. Okay so I wore this to work one night and didn't get any action for about 5 hours and thought it had became and skin scent by this time, I was called to a production line to do a changeover and I walk past a coworker she stopped in her tracks and said boy you smell good as hell what is that.  I told her the name she did not know what I was saying so she made me write it down for her, so as I was writing it down we had to get even closer and she said damn that smells good, when I get I'm going home and suck some dick. Lol I didn't know what to say after that so I said tell him he can thank me later I guess.She went to Belk and got dude a bottle that same day.  She said they went out to dinner that night and a couple of chicks stopped to compliment him as if she wasn't even there and that his head was blown up all night. He is not a frag head like the rest of us but he may be now lol. True story</p>\n",

       "<div class=\"revND\" style=\"background: #FEF2C4; position: relative;\"><p>I have already written a review on this fragrance, but I will go a little off topic here,, but it relates to this fragrance..  I remember writing a long email to fragrantica years ago telling them how good of an idea it would be if they allowed people to vote on the longevity and projection and different things to keep a \"score\" rating.  Ironically shortly after they did exactly that.  Most likely they had the idea already and already heard suggestions like this from many people, but the timing was odd to say the least<br/><br/>\n",
       "   Now I am changing my tune..I think the rating system can be extremely misleading.  With all the changes in formulations.. Fragrantica is having a hard time keeping track of them all.  You got people voting on this fragrance as \"beast mode\" how many years ago?  I will make another suggestion to fragrantica..  I think it might be a good idea to reset the rating after a certain amount of time. and start fresh.. For example.. Instead of coming to this page and seeing 900 people voting this fragrance as beast mode back in 2009... Have a history profile of the fragrances.. In other words we are voting now.. and the average is being shown for the past 2 years.  There could also be a summary of what this fragrance was rated previously.. So every X amount of years, the fragrance gets a new scoring.. Right now people looking at this page reading a review will see \"scoring for 2015-2016\"..  This would make the rating system a lot more accurate and up to date.  Leaving it the way it is now.. U get 300 people sayin the fragrance has shit longevity and 800 saying beast mode.. it is not coherent anymore and doesn't reflect the accuracy of the newer formulations..</p>\n",

       "Since childhood, “Isabelle” had dreamed of traveling to New York City and visiting the Empire State Building, looking out on the city from the observation deck, and hopefully, seeing the Statue of Liberty off in the distance.  Now that she is older, mid-thirties with a husband and kids of her own, the time came for a  mini family vacation.  Dad could not make the trip – some excuse about important clients and other meetings to attend, which suited the rest of the family just fine.  The trip was huge success, highlighted by a memorable trip to the Empire State Building.  It was a cool and brisk autumn evening when Isabelle, family in tow,  visited the 86th floor open-air deck.  They chose evening to see all the lights of NYC – the evening did not disappoint and the family was awestruck.  It was a dream come true.  <br/><br/>\n",
       "Isabelle happened to notice a tour group that shared the same enthusiasm.  One man, in particular – the group leader – caught Isabelle’s attention.  He spoke broken English and would frequently revert back to his native tongue that Isabelle guessed Italian.  He was truly happy and full of life – and it showed, from the inside out. While leading his group on the tour, they passed Isabelle’s family and he stopped to exchange pleasantries with Isabelle.  She noticed his dark eyes and stylish clothing to include his scarf that was clearly not purchased nor made in America.  She was also intrigued by the fragrance he wore as he passed in the night – she thought of the outdoors, herbs, and being out in the woods.  This was a fragrance for professional and distinguished gentlemen.  Under a full and clearly visible moon, she took a deep breath in and savored this moment.  The group tour continued at a much quicker pace than Isabelle’s family and she noticed they made their way back inside and waited for the elevator to take them back to street level and out into the city.  When it was time for Isabelle and family to leave, she noticed a scarf – the scarf – had been dropped by the door.  Isabelle hurried to the scarf and picked it up, finding the name “Nicho” on a label embroidered on one side.  She also noticed the scarf had the pleasant smells of the fragrance Nicho wore.  There were no signs of the group tour inside nor at street level to return the scarf.  Isabelle kept the scarf as reminder of the trip and night a dream came true…  <br/><br/>\n",
       "After returning home, and just prior to Christmas, Isabelle was walking through a department store at the local shopping mall when she stopped in her tracks - there it was… The fragrance that permeated the air around her – it was Nicho - it was the “man of the night”.  When she asked about the fragrance – it was La Nuit de l’Homme..  Some people come into your life for a reason… To be continued… <br/><br/>\n",
       "YSL’s La Nuit de l’Homme is a beautiful fragrance that should be in any collection.  Geared mainly for Fall and Winter wear and especially for evening events.  It is a crowd pleaser that will garner many compliments – La Nuit is one of a kind.. My final tally of La Nuit is 4.7 stars out of 5 stars.  You will not be disappointed… <br/><br/>\n",
       "Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…</p>\n",

I have gotten several comments in just 3 days of wearing it, from women of all ages.  It is a very mature, manly gentleman scent,.   it opens with Vetiver, it moves into a nice lavender scent, sweet and calming that will make girl melt in your arms.   A very simple scent, but that gives it more charm.  This is going to be a staple on my dresser for a long time.</p>\n",

       "<div class=\"revND\" style=\"background: #FEF2C4; position: relative;\"><p>I just happened to stumble upon this fragrance the other day while sniffing around at the store. I usually avoid fragrances that carry labels such as “pantydropper”, “ladykiller”, encourage you to buy something for others (in this case chicks… supposedly so sexually interesting to really care to drop their pants) and generally propagate the myth that whoever you are, wear this and…without hyperbole you’ll have frenzied women busting through doors, running over one another, chasing you to death around the city and in short battling whose gonna grab your cock first. Then I reconsidered and thought that it is an YSL and made by Ropion. <br/>\n",
       "I really don't understand the craze with this fragrance. Dominique Ropion is a very talented perfumer but I get the feeling that every time a big hitter comes on the selves what has preceded is a conversation of the sort “throw a few pleasant aromachemicals, make it a tad sweet, polish the angles to the point of dullness and let’s throw it in the market to see what happens”. When the first sales start going good then the conversation continues “…well you know it’s just something I “composed” in one day while watching the six o’clock news but what the heck who cares people say it’s good so leave it as is and let’s make a fortune”.  I won’t take time analyzing the fragrance since as with great scents, bottom “compositions” are pointless of analysis and this one certainly flies low. This not because it isn't artistic or whatever banal you may think of but just because it smells wrong. <br/>\n",
       "Perhaps the good old days never existed but some firms, YSL included, used to bother making a new fragrance and made great efforts in delivering something noteworthy. This opportunistic new-era ideals and their consequent releases make me wonder where the fuck are we going.<br/>\n",
       "But the ladies love it… well I simply don’t!</p>\n",

Anytime ive worn this ive had some women say some vulgar things to me. No lie.The most recent time was when i visited NY and i was having drinks in my hotel the trump soho i started with drinks at the bar with someone i met in the bar and ended my drink in her room.

When I first bought it, I was spraying it onto scent strips all the time, just so I could smell it. It is a bit sweet and soft, but also has a definite masculine, sensual, sexy tone to it. I think that really limits its use. I don't think I would wear this during the day to the office or out clubbing. This is more of a \"getting drinks\" scent or a \"intimate dinner\" scent, although I guess it could also work at a quieter classier bar. I wore this on a first date last weekend, and had a 2nd date planned before the first one had even ended. Not the best projection, but ideally, on an intimate night, you and your romantic partner won't be that far apart. If you are wearing this, I hope that you are trying to seduce someone, because I that is what it was made for.<br/><br/>\n",

What a disgusting scent this is! First of all it is very feminine. I am amazed it is marketed as male's fragrance! There's something pungent and overwhelmingly powdery about the scent. What's worse is there's a note that resembles sweat in my opinion. It's almost near the limit of being repulsive. And, as is the case with most scents of this type, it is also very strong and overpowering. Two hours after wearing it, it was still causing me nausea so I couldn't stand it anymore and went to wash it out. It is now probably two hours after I have thoroughly washed it off and I can still smell it on my wrist... I can't really understand people who think it is weak. I guess those are people with weakened or malfunctioning olfaction which could explain why they like it :) Sorry, couldn't resist the urge to hate... But I am so disappointed. I am glad I didn't purchase it blindly! By the way, my girlfriend said it was just OK but she wouldn't compliment anyone wearing this scent.</p>\n",

This is my first YSL frag and i'm impressed. I can't speak on the reformulation issue nor can I speak on performance yet but if the performance is there then you won't find a better fall/winter frag. La Nuit reminds of CK Shock Pour Homme but more refined, less sweet, &amp; more masculine. I'm surprised i'm one of the few to make the connection between Shock &amp; La Nuit. My vote still goes to La Nuit due to quality and it's richer scent. <br/><br/>\n",

To be honest, bought this blind, based on the reviews on this site, just to fill my shopping cart that contained the vintage Paco Rabanne and discontinued jewel  Arpege from Lanvin, that I just adore. I just added this one to the cart in order to get them to Dubai from EBay so that shipping cost spreads over three bottles. I am so glad  I made this purchase and this one is the first YSL that I am loving after trying and discarding  Kouros, Body Kurous, Jazz and Live Jazz. <br/><br/>\n",

The barber cutting my hair had a bottle of La Nuit sitting on his table &amp; he generously sprayed me with it after he finished cutting my hair.. I was immediately extremely impressed with this fragrance, it was at the time very different from anything I had ever smelled before.. Not long after I bought a bottle of La Nuit de L'Homme at Macy's for myself because I couldn't stop thinking about it! At the time I had no experience with the original L'Homme, but after finding out that La Nuit de L'Homme was a flanker to the original L'Homme I took it upon myself to get to know L'Homme also, &amp; after having done so I found out where La Nuit gets it all from! La Nuit has a lot of that signature L'Homme DNA but here we have lavender instead of ginger and more of a focus on spices &amp; woody notes.. La Nuit opens up very spicy, with a gorgeous cardamom note.. The spicy cardamom opening of La Nuit is just simply intoxicating! Lavender &amp; cedar make their self known in the heart adding body &amp; creating a very nice powdery vibe, while a touch of bergamot balances these notes out.. As La Nuit dries down a sweet creamy base of coumarin takes over along with a touch of vetiver.. La Nuit is very spicy &amp; pretty sweet, yet it still has somewhat of a fresh airy touch which is very appealing.. La Nuit takes the DNA of L'Homme darkens it, amps it up &amp; in turn La Nuit is very much a more sexy mysterious night time oriented take on L'Homme.. La Nuit has become quite popular &amp; it even seems to overshadow the original fragrance to which it is a flanker of \"L'Homme\", not to many flankers can do that! It was love at first sniff to me with La Nuit de L'Homme &amp; that has not changed at all throughout the years! I am very much looking forward to getting to know the Le Parfum version of La Nuit better along with the other flankers of La Nuit such as Frozen Cologne, &amp; L'Intense..</p>\n",

La Nuit smells a bit sophisticated -- although it is also a bit of a colder weather scent, or at least, a night time scent (imagine that!) That hurts its versatility, but La Nuit smells a bit of class, and just smells... sophisticated. I just find it a touch too powder heavy. I still like it though!<br/><br/>\n",

The younger girls don't compliment this one that much, the youngest lady that complimented me was a friend and she is 23yrs old. I would say if you want to attract a more sexy mature woman try this scent out! This fragrance is definitely more grown and sexy, I don't really see an 18yr old guy pulling this one off unless he is properly dressed and mature like.

It projects for around 2 hours before turning into a skin scent. The scent of this fragrance is 10/10 throughout the entire time it's on my skin but the projection is very poor and the longevity is good if you count it sitting close to the skin. People said it lasted 10+ hours easily. It does last that long but after 2 hours it's so close to the skin that no one notices it.mi did buy a travel atomizer so I can refresh it when it stops projecting but I am still disappointed. The smell is so good I was hoping for better performance. It smells like something is burning. The first thing that comes to mind is incense.<br/><br/>\n",

       "<div class=\"revND\" style=\"background: #FBEFD4; position: relative;\"><p>This is definitely meant to be a night scent, after all \"La Nuit\" means \"The Night\" so it is pretty explicit.  The way I had heard about this scent was that it was great for a night of getting cozy.  If you wanted something that would smell great, last all night, but not overwhelm the person you are cuddling up with, then La Nuit was the go-to.  Wearing something really strong with monster projection might overwhelm them.  My expectations were pretty much met.  La Nuit has the interesting character of having decent longevity without too much projection.  I find YSL Pour Homme to be the same, you need to lean in to smell it (unless you really spritz it on).<br/><br/>\n",
       "There's something to be said about that.  The moment when someone is talking to someone, not smelling anything, but they need to lean in for whatever reason and then say, \"hey, you smell really good!\"  It gives the impression more that you just smell good than that you are wearing something that smells good.  YSL seems to go for this approach: restrained, reserved on the projection front, but smelling really good.<br/><br/>\n",
       "La Nuit is extremely popular (sorry to those who think this is a big secret), so some folks will bash it for that reason.  It isn't a projection monster, so some will bash it for that.  It isn't the most bold scent.  La Nuit doesn't have 20 notes, so some might bash it for that reason.  Yet, overall this is solid, well-known juice that a man should at least try for himself.  It definitely isn't a super-brawny, butch type of masculine though.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Having experimented with other fragrances, knowing my preferences and body chemistry, I'd probably never buy La Nuit for myself.  Yet, I can see it working well for plenty of guys.</p>\n",

Personally i like the Le Perfume version a lot more, maybe because of the peppery and fruity scent but this is me! Also the next YSL will be Le Perfume because it is perfume, not EDT! In the beginning of my review i said that this one is for women, and i guess it will be liked by women a lot more than the Le Perfume version, and i will try and test which one of them is more likable by women! Still in my mind the Pour Homme II is unbeaten by any other scent till now!</p>\n",

       "<div class=\"revND\" style=\"background: #F5F4F8; position: relative;\"><p>This is quite a popular scent on here, so of course I had to try it. The top notes are near immaculate, being sweet and lovely like a flowered apple cider. The mid notes, however, take a turn I don't necessarily like. Plastic? Yeah, I smell plastic and flowers. Like Wendy's plastic toys, but not nearly as good. The drydown brings repulsion- I don't think anyone would compliment you once you reach this. I requested many women to smell this on me today (various stages) and the results were not nearly as impressive and decisive as the humorous reviews on YouTube and Amazon seem to promise. This is not a \"panty dropper\" for me at all. It smells okay. It almost takes itself too seriously, particularly since its lack of quality ingredients becomes obvious: it acts like it is well blended, but ultimately remains affectatious. La Nuit de L'homme's biggest flaw is its overall boring feel once you actually wear it. It was beautiful on paper, but on my flesh it just produced too many \"bleck!\" notes that probably don't appear on others. The scent just got boring and unwanted on me today. Considering the positive press and jubilant endorsement by fellow fumeheads, I'm very much dissappointed. Try on your skin before you buy. Projection is moderate to soft and great longevity (I still smell it, but still not something I enjoy for myself). I'm sticking with the even more boring aquatics, which at least make me feel confident inside.<br/><br/>\n",
       "EDIT: I've found this to be the most popular cologne on my college campuses. I've smelled this far more than 1 Million or even Aqcua di Gio. Be warned, you won't stand out as much as you may think- the curse of a popular fragrance.</p>\n",

This accord stays for about an hour on my skin. Imagine sweetness with something dark in the background. It's not the kind of pepper that stings your nostrils, though. You can definitely smell it, but it's still rather smooth. Then, I start smelling bergamot. It's a really nice bergamot note that is very prominent on my skin, and nearly acts as the main player, while the cardamom (and the other notes) acts as a sweet background. This cologne projects moderately (about an arm's length) for an hour, then starts dying down. Four hours into it, it's pretty much a skin scent, and I get whiffs of bergamot mixed with a sort of vanilla sweetness. I love this fragrance, but wish it projected a little more. I wouldn't want to a projection monster, but it would be nice if it were just a little more noticeable. I'll try it on my clothes, too, and see how it performs there. All in all, I'd probably give it a 9 out of 10, mainly because of its weak projection, and questionable longevity.<br/>\n",
       "I'd wear this year-round, because it's light enough. It's lighter than Dior Homme Intense (2013), and sometimes I wear that in summer, so I don't see why I wouldn't wear this. Then again, it's a strictly personal choice.</p>\n",

       "<div class=\"revND\" style=\"background: #FBFEC4; position: relative;\"><p>I recently purchased a 60ml edt of La Nuit de L'Homme. Upon the first few sprays, I really get a sense of the clean lavender smell right away. As the scent dries down, I get more of the cardamom note. The lavender is listed as a middle note but I get it right off the bat, maybe it's just me though. The scent is very clean, comes across as professional, but could also be seen as as unisex because of the strong flowery notes. Also a bit of a powdery note that comes in with the dry down. Overall, this is a great fragrance. It can be used for every day wear, but my suggestion is save it for the date nights and formal events. As for silage and projection, it lasts for most of the day on skin (about 8-12 hours) and lasts for days on clothing. It is not a \"loud\" fragrance, it leaves a slight trail but nothing major. Most people probably won't smell it unless they're within 5 or so feet of you. <br/><br/>\n",
       "My recommendations: 2-4 sprays on your neck/arms, avoid using it during hot weather because it may become more apparent than you wish.<br/><br/>\n",

I got a sampler of this cologne because of all the amazing reviews that I read about it, but it is very much NOT for me.  Maybe it's just bad chemistry between this fragrance and I, but every time I wear it I am left with an aching head and an itchy, rashed arm.  I'm not sure why this scent has so many good reviews, because in my honest opinion it has an overly sweet and incredibly powerful, cloying smell, but again, it could just be because of my skin type.  I had my brother try it as well and he had the same results.  Please keep in mind that both of us are fairly young, and thus our noses might not yet be mature enough or whatever to enjoy the scent alone, regardless of its interaction with our skin.  I do not recommend this fragrance for individuals with oily skin, but everybody is different, so try it out for yourself!<br/><br/>\n",

My girlfriend loves it and literally sticks her neck and hair to my neck, so that she can have my scent too, she says, and she kisses me in the neck a lot. Projection: She says (among other people) that she knows when I'm around because she can smell my scent, so, I guess it´s pretty good. Longevity: I´ve applied it 6 hours before seeing my girlfriend and she says \"you always smell so good, and a lot\", also, I get comments from other people saying to me things like: \"what fragrance are you wearing?\" late at night, even if I had applied it in the afternoon. Now it is my favorite scent, and at first I didn´t find it special and thought it was pure hype, and nothing but cardamom... OOOhh boy, how wrong I was!</p>\n",

Finally, I picked up a gift set with a 3.3oz bottle, aftershave, and body wash for only $34!! I love this fragrance!! Don't listen to all the haters. they can have there own opinion but I love this smell so much! It opens incredibly smooth with the spice from the cardamon and lavender. Then I get the bergamot and caraway, cedar, and vetiver. I definitely can pick up all the notes but the vetiver is probably the least noticeable. The dry down is woody and powdery. Overall the scent is fairly aromatic but still remains on the dark side. <br/>\n",
       "Although the name suggests it is only for the \"night\" you can wear this anytime you want. Fall, winter, spring, and maybe even summer (But go easy on the sprays). As for occasions I can see wearing this going out, casually, formally, and even to work. The longevity is really good (At least 8 hours) and the sillage is also good. I sprayed this once on my wrist and I caught wiffs of it for at least 3 hours!! Then the scent dies down a bit but will definitely get noticed. Another positive is that the bottle is really sexy looking!! It matches the juice inside! What an amazing scent from YSL. Excellently blended, smells sexy, and performs really well (Not beast mode, but just right). I highly recommend this cologne to anybody!<br/><br/>\n",

I walked by and then I overheard them saying something smelled really good. They wondered what it was and finally the one lady said I think it was that man's cologne.

Some sexy warm colognes can be a bit too much and some clean fresh colognes are sometimes not sexy or memorable enough, well this has both, perfect combo. I can see this on a man of any age, easy to wear non offensive. Men colognes should not be too complex or loud in my opinion, they should be simple light with a hint of sexiness. You don't want to seem like you're trying too hard or cover up your own manly scent. YSL La nuit is defenitely not something I would mind a man wearing and I'm not too big on men wearing cologne.</p>\n",

The drydown is superb slightly powdery and a very clean cedar/vetiver.   The citrus and fruity berry vibe comes more to the forefront than the spice which is probably what makes this fragrance so socially excepted and commercially successful.

       "I read up a lot on fragrance on the internet and decide which ones I'd like to try and buy. Through to the many great recommendations on fragrantica I've purchased some amazing bottles - which all lived up to the hype... Dior Homme Intense, Fahrenheit, Pure Malt etc... <br/><br/>\n",
       "What I mean is, upon smelling these fragrances I can see why they're held in such high esteem. One that always appears on fragranticas forums usually under some \"sexiest scents for men\" type threads - is La Nuit De l'Homme. So on that I figured this has got to be in the league of all the other hyped scents. I tried it in department stores numerous times... Literally spraying it onto my hand, wrist, neck and not being able to smell anything at all apart from a very very weak airy smell with a slightly alcohol opening. I didn't get any of the \"very sweet\" or \"long lasting with great silage\" comments. Quite the opposite. So I was perplexed by the high praise for this fragrance.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Long story short - I was out shopping 2 weeks ago and I found a little gem of a store which sold unused tester bottles of all the fragrances they stocked. All legit. I purchased others that I already own/ran out of too. They were selling these bottles half price so I decided to take a chance on La Nuit.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Now I've had two weeks to experiment with it, in which I've worn it every day. I do now like the scent quite a lot. In fact it has been addictive for me. I can't stop smelling it and I do agree with the \"sexy\" label it has been given. It is definitely subtly confident, mysterious and alluring.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Now here's my problem with it... I can't get it to last anything more than an hour. Literally I sprayed 20 sprays on one day as a test. On my neck hands chest, clothes. Projects for about the first 30 minutes before becoming a skin scent - only been able to smell if I press my nose right up against my skin. <br/><br/>\n",
       "So I thought this may be my chemistry, skin type etc. I've tried spraying it on others to see if I can smell it. Not only was their no projection, the person I sprayed it on never got whiff of it after the initial blast. I sprayed about 6-7 sprays on them.<br/><br/>\n",
       "I'm not sure if La Nuit has been reformulated and the projection and silage people are posting about is an older version but I definitely can't get anything from this juice. Which is a real shame because I love the scent. In fact I'd be quite happy to let it into my top 10 if it weren't for this problem. <br/><br/>\n",
       "Bit perplexed by it. I'm wondering if I buy the deodorant stick and apply the juice on the top of that or mix it with the deodorant spray. It's a real shame about the performance of this fragrance as I'm very fond of the actual scent.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Unfortunately I wouldn't recommend buying unless you test it thoroughly and see how the longevity and projection is for you.</p>\n",

I think you will be hard pressed to find anyone who genuinely dislikes this fragrance, as it is an unbelievably sensual, classy and seductive fragrance. <br/><br/>\n",

       "One of my favorite fragrances of all time, this timeless masterpiece is sweet, spicy and aromatic. This one really takes L’Homme to a whole new level of intensity and attitude. While L’Homme is much too safe (for better or for worse), La Nuit de L’Homme pushes the envelope in dark men’s fragrances. I am unconditionally supportive of its being labeled ‘Nuit’ (French for night), since it is much too seductive and potent for daytime use. <br/><br/>\n",
       "The first few hours entail a fresh yet heavy blast of cardamom, a note with which many of you may be unfamiliar, but is authentically portrayed in this bottle. Then as this fragrance dries down, a smooth harmony of lavender, bergamot and woods will grace everyone around you. <br/><br/>\n",
       "OBJECTIVE<br/><br/>\n",
       "This L’Homme derivative outshines all the others when it comes to performance. This cologne is the quintessential aromatic, airy fragrance. It is strong because it reaches everyone in the room and leaves a long trail, but does so in such an innocent way. Paradoxically, it smells heavy on the skin but light in the air. Such is the magic of the La Nuit de L’Homme’s performance. Furthermore, it projects all day with only three sprays around the neck. Be warned, this scent smells synthetic when applied to clothes. Also, avoid spraying in the heat, as its strength will easily work against you (bergamot in particular is pungent on sweaty skin). Moreover, this bottle, like all L’Homme bottles, is timeless, and looks beautiful in your collection unboxed.<br/><br/>\n",
       "IMPRESSION<br/><br/>\n",
       "The best Yves Saint Laurent cologne for its unique scent and performance, La Nuit de L’Homme is an aromatic masterpiece for the cool air.  No other fragrance has blended cardamom, bergamot and lavender so finely, a combination that nicely balances sweet and spicy. It is, on the other hand, not as versatile as L’Homme, and should be reserved for occasions when you feel on top of your game.<br/><br/>\n",
       "PLAN<br/><br/>\n",
       "Whether an amateur or a fragrance guru, hunt this one down straight away. Make sure that you seek feedback from others, as this one smells better in the air (more fresh and aromatic) than on the skin (more spicy and concentrated). If you are a fragrance collector, go ahead and blind-buy this one, in which case shame on you for not having already smelled this jewel among its designer counterparts. ★★★★★</p>\n",

The bergamot, lavender and cedar blend is an interesting one. It is done so seamlessly that I find it hard to pick out the individual notes. It's just this unique aroma, very \"fresh and clean\" feeling with a spicy touch.  I think it makes for a great day and night fragrance.<br/><br/>\n",

My current collection is around 35 bottles and this stuff is at the top of the list. I am not an expert in Niche perfumes I think they are too overpriced (except the legendary Creed lines), but YSL Nuit is as good a designer as I have smelled. It is highly mysterious and inoffensive, so not many will complain about it. I suggest going heavy, but not too heavy, on the trigger. This juice is sexy, dark, and mysterious but there is a fruit accord that is literally mouth watering. I absolutely love this stuff and would say this is easily the best YSl offering, and I am a huge fan of Kouros and Body Kouros. Do not be afraid to over apply, as 8 to 10 sprays is ok in my opinion. YSL Nuit is a gem!!!</p>\n",

This is the ONLY frag to ever do so in the decades ive been collecting.  It happens every time i spray it.  Very odd. <br/><br/>\n",

It might be a good frag for close contact situations, but only after a couple of hours breathing time and possibly a stiff martini (or 2).  I dont think of it as a business appropriate scent.  Its just not the place for it.  Def a date scent promising an overnight guest.  Dinner, clubbing, nighttime, low humidity conditions would yield its best performance.<br/><br/>\n",

In this case cardamom replaces ginger, lavender replaces violet leaf, and coumarin instead of tonka bean.  These substitutions allow sweeter spice notes and a deeper floral presence.  Cedar and vetiver are present in both for the needed spash of masculinity and element of cleanness.  On my skin this has excellent sillage and lasts 10-12 hrs consistently and is easily detected, even by me.  One spray to each side of my neck is all that is needed.  What I enjoy about both is after they die down to skin scents, when you heat up just a little, the smell they project is beautiful.  I do prefer the original L'homme to this because of its versatility.  The former fragrance can be worn in any weather except for very hot days.  This fragrance is for cooler days/nights IMHO and is more outright sexy than L'homme.  I would say where L'homme is an attractive female that as you get to know her more she becomes extremely beautiful, LNDLH is that \"I'm sexy and I know it\" female that attracts you instantly.  With either fragrance, you can't go wrong.</p>\n",

The first time I smelled it on paper, it was unremarkable.  Since it had tons a good reviews, I tried it on my forearm.  It still didn't entice me.  The clerk told me to let it settle.  When it began to change, I noticed this dark spice that lingered in my nose.  I was still ambivalent to the scent, though.  I let my friend sniff, and she enjoyed it.  I asked strangers for their opinion, and they thought it was pretty good.  Lavender, vetiver, caraway, and cardamom created this warm, chocolatey, and spicy ambiance around my arm.  The more I let it sit, the more I wanted to smell it.  I now see the beauty of this perfume.</p>\n",

So for those that complain about the projection or longevity,,, get like me and spend $100 on the 6.7oz and go nutz on the trigger!!!! At first I had the 1.7oz  an only applied 4 sprays. Two neck and each wrist. Smelled great but didnt project and garner the compliments I was looking for.  But it was okay bc my fiancé loves it and could easily smell it when she was close to me. Cuddling, hugging etc. But I wanted more. So when it was time to re-up, I purchased the Man size 6.7 bottle!! And the first use I went HAM (hard as a <a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"3b56544f535e495d7b58505e49\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a>) 12 sprays!! All over my skin and a few on my shirt. And BAM,,,, the compliments started rolling in. The first time was this cute bartender,, Jill. Her exact words from inside the bar (a good 4-6 feet away) were, \"omg what kind of cologne are you wearing? (I answered) Wow that smells really good like yummy,, mmmm!\" In my head I was like \"wow!! She can smell me from that far away?!?\"<br/>\n",
       "So,, yeah guys. This is a must have!! Just gotta lay it on thick. Don't worry, it won't be cloying. Especially if its night time winter weather. (I wouldn't wear this in the daytime) Also,, make sure you moisturizer your skin with a unscented lotion or something. You WILL get 2-3 hours of monster projection, about 2-3 hours of good projection, and the rest will be huggin distance projection. It will be on your shirt the next morning as well. Solid performer!!!</p>\n",

The smell it's amazing and gets much compliments, but only from who are close to you, because de projections is below average on me. If you're the guy that don't like clubbing, that's the night scent made for you. The smell is a like a L'homme toned down. Start with a soft lavanda mixed with a strong cardomom that stays until the end. The base it's a vanilla mixed with tonka, bringing a cream smell, close to the base of Dior homme reformulated.<br/><br/>\n",

I used it for clubbing, diner, romantic purpose and any evening occasion. Smell great, receive a lot of compliment and i find it kind of dark, not the usual fragrance that smell  clean. As i said before, a weapon of mass seduction with women. Boost my confident while wearing it and i feel like i need to chase after girl :p A single man smell, i would said 25 yr and over. When it come to longevity and projection factor, im a little bit disapointed. It last for 5 hours and project about arm length. Could have ben close to perfection if the longevity and projection were a little bit better. I think it is ok to wearit at night all year around, from summer to winter, because it is not that strong (comparing to 1 million, it might seem weak for and evening scent). As for the EDP, i used to believe that it would be that artifact that i was looking for, but it is, in fact, a huge disappointement because it doesn t smell the same at all, only the base are similar and it project less. Here with the score:<br/><br/>\n",

I am 21 year old guy from Pakistan. If you are from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh. I wont recommend you to buy it because it smells like a market where people sell spices, bouquets, and ittars and It dosn't bring a good image to my mind. (This cologne smells like an Ittar too). Just imaging your self in that market how it smells or how people smells like in Taraweeh. This cologne smells exactly 10/10 like that. Well I blind bought this did'nt tested it before buying because I was so confident about it becuase of the reviews on youtube and on online forums. Its not worst but not the best or you can say what I expected, still wearable. It smells like a sour rotten apricot but in a good way after a hour. May be I did'n liked it because I like aquatic/summer fragrances alot because of the hot weather here. Recommended age for it IMO 25+. I tested JPG's Le Male there but rejected that because it is very common. I have smelled that on over a 100 people in different places and on different occasions but I just did'nt knew Its called Le Male. Will post about YSL La Nuit de l'Homme projection and longevity after I try it in a few days.</p>\n",

To me it smells like something really dated something an old man would wear. It almost reminds me the smell of mothballs. But other than that it's a very nice fragrance. I only wear this at night since I don't seem to enjoy it that much during the day. Also the scent is really seductive.  Projection and longevity are great on this one so be careful with the trigger.

Oddly I agree, I too get some sweet bubble gum scent that is balanced in spices. I can see how this is an appealing and darker scent to some but honestly I enjoyed the original L'Homme SO much more perhaps because I would wear it myself even haha. I love the spicy woody floral character that one has- La Nuit is just too much like gum of feminine quality. If this was darker with an incense or woody smell I would probably enjoy it more, so perhaps I will try layering? This however I think is suitable for casual evening wear. It is more on the inoffensive and discreet side despite the good quality. <br/>\n",

It opens with a light bergamot and lavender in a  completely traditional male cologne manner, but even the top is already suffused with cardamom. The long-lasting middle is a gorgeous slightly sweet cardamom blend, enriched by a lingering lavender herbal note, a touch of cumin, and woody notes. The cardamom eventually fades into a base of cedar and vetiver that blends nicely with the spicy middle. Some reviewers mention a vanilla that I don't detect.<br/><br/>\n",
       "I would call La Nuit de L'Homme a spicy scent rather than a gourmand, though it is subtly sweet and cardamom is rarely so dominant in spicy perfumes. The middle is soft and seductive, rich and mysterious, and  completely unisex. I love the scent and I don't know of anything else that smells like it. A good cool weather scent and a good choice for a first date - my experience is that most women don't want you to smell \"manly\" (sharp, herbal, sweaty, woody), they want you to smell like a woman but less floral-fruity. Well, maybe that is just the women I know...</p>\n",

Definitely a unique smell that'll leave it's mark in someones memory.</p>\n",

The drydown is soft and powdery with a mix of green herbal-ness. As the fragrance dries down you you quickly lose the coriander scent that makes this fragrance unique. There's a very sweet powdery lavender scent that reminds me a little of   Dolce &amp; Gabbana's \"The One\". This is definitely a mature evening fragrance. I like it, but I wouldn't buy a whole bottle of it.</p>\n",

Then finally I gave it a try and I was so pleased with La Nuit I ordered it, le Parfum and the Frozen Cologne almost at once. for me it is delicious lavender scent, not much of macho lavender, but it borders baby like powedered scent. I had two papper strips with original and Cologne, of course the later dissapeared with no time at all, but the original been sitting on my desk at home since last Tuesday and I still get this lovely not so sweet scent in thte air. Sexy, no please. And I am not a Brit, no harm intended. Defenetely a strong fragrance, and also I think it doesn't have much of a  time or season. It is all down to the amount one applies.

He walks to the bathroom, looks at himself in the mirror \"I can shave tomorrow\", smells his left armpit \"but I should shower before I leave\". He fixes himself a macchiato from that fancy espresso machine. He despises people who say \"expresso\". He cannot stand people who cannot qualify wine passed \"red\" or \"white\" he thinks as he empties last night's pinotage down the drain. He's woken up a few fruit flies, he grunts as he washes the alcohol down with water. He has a bit of a headache. He's glad last night's girl didn't try to spend the morning, but rather grabbed her things and left in the middle of the night. That's one of her main qualities. That, and her tits, of course. She gets that he doesn't want any ties at the moment. He did the whole relationship thing before, once or twice. It lasted a few years. But that was a few years back, when he was an undergraduate. It feels like he was another man then. No, he was a boy back then. Now, he's a man. At least that's what he likes to think. \"Hrm, milk went sour...it'll have to be an Americano then.\" He walks to the living room, puts his cup of coffee on the table, sits on his black leather couch. He grabs his iPad from under a copy of the New Yorker - \"do I find it classy or just downright annoying that they always use italics and French spelling when there's an English word of French origin? Who cares really, I don't even really read the damn thing...\" - He has a quick look at his accounts. In the red. He should try to live according to his income, but he can't. Worst case scenario, dad will bail him out. He always does. He's lucky he's an only son, from a rather wealthy family. He spent 6 years studying American literature, then philosophy and finally psychology. The last one was his favourite. He learned how to be even more manipulative and lazy. And the classes were filled with half-crazy nymphets with daddy issues. As long as you pretend to listen to them, it's quite easy to get them naked. As he drinks the last drop of coffee, he gets up and finally takes a shower. \"Maybe I should go back to the gym\" he ponders as he scrubs his early-stage beer belly with a luffa. He dries himself with the towel he was previously wearing. \"Maybe I should write my memoirs\" he thinks as he reaches for the bottle of La Nuit de l'Homme next to the sink.</p>\n",

It works better and is more appreciated on cold nights but if one is easy on the trigger it can be pulled off on a breezy summer night.  I am not a fan of the original l'Homme and this one only harbors I would say a skeleton of it. It is its own.  It has been described as a fragrance of contradictions, absolute right.  Cardamom vs lavender. Bergamont vs vetiver and cedar. Gives off a very rich vibe. An absolute lady KILLER.  Have never received more compliments from the opposite sex on any other fragrance. Another wonderful fragrance, designed for a gentleman from the YSL house.</p>\n",

I tested it today but since we are approaching spring, decided not to buy it since it is a heavy winter/fall smell. I will however, be purchasing this in september. It bursts out of the bottle with a strong herbal/sweetness which kind of made me think it's heavily copied in other fragrances. The drydown was the selling point for me though, which gets quite spicy, but very smooth at the same time. It lasted a good while on my hand so I know it's durable for winter. It reminded of a stronger Armani Code in the base. They are definitely in the same class of fragrances so if you like that, and resent the subtlety of it, you'll love this. Try before you buy it because I was expecting something COMPLETELY different based on the notes given. Also, this is probably the highest Like/Love to dislike ratio I've seen with the most amount of votes. That alone tells me it's worthy of any collection. Still, for people who hate sweet/spicy frags, you'd better try it<br/><br/>\n",
       "Edit: So I gave in and bought it today. I love it. It's just the spicy/sweetness that I like and will draw tons of compliments. I will be rocking this all spring long but not in weather that exceeds 70 degrees. It's too heavy for hot weather.</p>\n",

It may be an anytime fragrance for many, but my preference is to wear it in the evening for more formal occasions. It is stronger and longer lasting than most of my fragrances which is precisely what I wanted to add. This masculine yet sweet aromatic will become a staple in my collection that I shall turn to, often. It is an elegant masculine fragrance that may soon become my signature scent. Quite warm and sensual!</p>\n",

It becomes much more approachable as it dries, but is very overpowering when first applied so only a couple sprays are needed. I'd agree with the reviewer below that it reminds me of  more sophisticated AXE scent and is not particularly original. In my mind, the man who wears this is in his forties, has a wife, is masculine in the American sense, and has settled into his habits for life. This scent is not adventurous or sexy in the conventional sense. Instead it's appeal is that it is  comfortingly familiar and warm, which can be sexy in its own right.</p>\n",

La Nuit is more of a mature scent, I'm not saying that this smells old, it is just mature, more appealing for adults than for teens or guys in their 20's<br/><br/>\n",

The EDT however is warmer and more accessible and spicy in my opinion, while Le Parfum is 'colder', more 'dark' and subtle.  I find that the EDT leaves a stronger trail, farther away from the skin.

Gotta order some of that juice!\" Got this beauty in today and wow. I love this fragrance. One of the gems of YSL for sure. This fragrance is very sweet to me all the way through.

The dry down is so worth it.  LNdL has a warm, spiced apple cider quality to it.  I'm not sure what accounts for the apple accord, but it's delicious!  The combination of cardamom, cedar, and caraway is so comforting.  I think it would be fantastic for the colder months, but could be pulled off year round.  Yes, I am female, but I do love men's fragrances - not so much to WEAR, but to smell (and that often means wearing them lol) :)  I sampled this, along with several other fragrances (men's and women's) and found myself continuously asking, \"Which one of these fragrances smells so good?!\" and having it always be this one.  Sophisticated without being \"old\" and dated, sexy as hell without being ostentatious.  The sillage and longevity seem about average-above average.</p>\n",

But somehow I didn't bother/dare as I've lost faith in this brand since the man himself died. Their ideas and quality have rather gone out of the window since then.<br/>\n",
       "I had tried the original at the time. It was rather nice, but as other have also commented, rather disappointing and forgettable. The big white plastic lid made it look rather cheap and unfinished. A darker scent and bottle seemed like just the way to go.<br/><br/>\n",
       "Yesterday I tested it on a paper strip and liked it enough to try a generous amount on the skin. While it isn't exactly ground breaking, it's definitely a very well-made composition. I can't identify all the notes, but bergamot and cedar are both prominent and bound to win me over. It's sweet and spicy, but in such a balanced way it was pleasant in warm humid weather. (Such weather often makes me despise even trusted favourites.) To me it's one of the few men's fragrances that get sweetness right, i.e. neither overpowering nor losing in manly appeal. My husband described it as a \"sawdust note\", most likely the cedar. (Which would not stop me from wearing it. :) I even seem to detect a fleeting similarity to the original women's Opium. This is a major plus, as the men's Opium is rather off-putting to me. <br/><br/>\n",
       "Later on it becomes rather more herbal, which I really enjoy. As it fades out almost 18 hours later, it still maintains a nice balance. Few drydowns manage this in my opinion. <br/><br/>\n",

       "This is truly awesome fragrance!  To me, if you can conjure imagery from a scent, then you have accomplished something unique and exceptional.  Your olfactory senses allow your mind to visualize...with La Nuit de l'Homme I find myself, \"...upon a dark, cool night with a light breeze and a full moon shining bright, radiating off of clouds.  I am in the woods - alone, but not afraid or cold. I am walking on a path to the one I love and I will be there soon...and, I know she is waiting for me.\"<br/><br/>\n",
       "Okay - a little cheesy, but this is honestly how transcendent YSL's juice is to me.  I first smelled this and was absolutely in love with the intoxicatingly rich and spicy cardamom - a note that I am already very fond of and I think this bottle has used it masterfully!  However, as singular as the nose is at first, it warms into a heart of gorgeous lavender (fresh, not dried) that is blended harmoniously with warm citrus (bergamot), which also lifts the accord and giving it a breeze of fresh air.  The cedar is not overly used or dusty - on the contrary - this is very rich and damp cedar.  The olfactory pleasure continues into the dry down with a nice fresh vetiver accord that is not overly \"rooty\" or earthy.  A slightly sharp, but also clean vetiver that melds with the cedar and lavender with the cardamom carrying through the whole composition.  This turns, on my skin (nothing short of amazing) slightly sweet, powdery blend of warm notes that just seem to breathe on my skin!  That is coumarin in the base...and it is used in perfect balance here.  A word of caution...don't over-apply.  But, feel free to wear a fair amount as this is not overly 'loud'.  <br/><br/>\n",
       "I have seen people say 4 shots - one on the chest, one each pulse point on the neck and one on the back of neck.  I think I would say that is about right - on a cold night (when this is perfect) maybe add one to the wrists.  This is a fantastic, radiating scent.  Maybe put one shot on the clothes, but this really feels fantastic (and smells right) on my skin.  <br/><br/>\n",
       "A true night-time scent - possibly year-round with milder application on a summer night, but absolutely do-able.  Stunning, dark, sexy as hell and chic!  Better for formal, but possible with up-scale casual attire.  This can wear you, if you are not confident and know what you want out of \"that night\". If you are in a Nascar shirt and jeans shooting pool and wear this, you have offended this fragrance and the bottle should be taken away from you at once.<br/><br/>\n",
       "My firm score - 9/10.  Don't try to make this work for you...ask your partner as you are close with them if this is something they like.  La Nuit de l'Homme is truly an intimate fragrance.  I believe most will love it, but if they don't then you need to find something that does - or possibly another partner.  Cheers.</p>\n",

There has got to be some sort of aphrodisiac in here cuz it makes me weak in the knees. I can't stand most aromatic spicy scents on my man because they always smell like my dad or my uncles. And I am not a fan of sickly sweet A-men type of scents because no man should smell like caramel or chocolate no matter how \"manly\" you are (call me \"sexist\" I dont care, everyone should embrace their own sex female or male and understand and accept the differences between them)...this one is just perfect. The bergamot gives it a nice youthful scent, mixed with the minty powdery cardamom which is always sexy on men, and of course snuggle \"come closer\" worthy lavender. Overall this is a soft spicy semi-powdery sweet woody scent, really all the goodies in one, whats not to love? <br/>\n",

I kept asking what is that smell, and after he laughed in delight of my cat like movements sniffing around, he came clean. My goodness this stuff is a turn on! It's truly \"Man candy\" stuff lol</p>\n",

       "<div class=\"revND\" style=\"background: #F5F4F8; position: relative;\"><p>I can't figure out what the hype is on this scent... I guess I attribute it to different tastes and different characters.  I got a trial - which I know is authentic - because of the Fresh Spicy/Warm Spicy descriptions, but I don't think either of those are remotely accurate.  It smells like talcum powder for the first ten minutes, and very feminine (almost like an herbal shampoo for girls), then it calms down to a fresh almost clean linen scent which isn't bad or feminine at all.  Not a bad cologne/perfume, just not very spicy or masculine in my opinion.  Very fresh and clean, though, if that's more your style. I'd definitely recommend buying a 2mL. sample vial before investing since I think body chemistry can seriously alter the smell of this one.  My friend just put it on and it smells completely different on him, something I've noticed with other scents, but not at this magnitude.</p>\n",

It smelled \"aftershavey\" to me, or like one of those smelly magazine ads. I don't think this is a very classy fragrance--at least not to me. It's too sweet and smells artificial and contrived. I didn't get natural-smelling spices. The lasting power is amazing--ten hours later I can still smell it on my wrist. Not a good thing, in this case.</p>\n",

The axe commercials should have been modeled behind it because I swear it just makes me wanna crawl, no, I take that back, CLAW my way up into my boyfriends shirt. It drives me insane in the best way and funny thing is that most times I can't stand colognes; they seem contrived therefore they annoy me and any man who wears them. I don't know that I would want to smell this on every man but it is a flattering scent, very musky, powdery and spicy but not in an old spice sharp or fakey way, its a scent that I would associate with someone. Its something I would have to give to someone to appreciate them wearing it. Its just that special to me. My bf wore it to his friends bachelor party and he told me that both the strippers told him he smelled good and refused to leave him. He told them that he smells the way his woman wants him to....damn right about that! lol Also, it lasts a LONG time but doesnt seem to sour or go weird on my bf, it just..stays.

The sweetness was so much so, that i thought i got an imitation bottle or something lol but after i checked it out, its the real deal. As for application, spraying this means just 2 or 3 shots because the sweetness can get to your head lol. It Mellows down to a nice base though. Its longevity, i give it a 10/10, last most of the day once you put it on though its better to wear at nights (especially when u from the Caribbean like me and the weather is really cool in the night lol). Its a nice cologne but I think it could've been better. Overall 8/10</p>\n",

La Nuit is basically the original L'Homme, this time with brown sugar-encrusted ginger dialed up to 11. Many of the exact same components are in place. I'm not really sure how this translates to a \"night\" fragrance, but apparently YSL decided that clubbers have a sweet tooth. As it ages on skin, the ginger recedes, leaving a cooler rendition of the original in place. It's okay I guess, but why bother?

What i love though is that this one is so non-chemical smelling. Its really earthy but pure. The trajectory is perfect. Smells spicy and mysterious. I could see walking into a spice shop, picking the listed ingredients, mixing them and it smelling like the fragrance. Thats awesome. A real organic cologne but easy to understand. <br/>\n",

Yes all in one. My female coworkers love this stuff and to be honest so did I. There is something with the tonka and maybe the ceader or some other note that makes it a sweet woodsy scent then you throw in some spices to awake the senses and you have a wonderful scent on your hand people. I absolutely love this thing.<br/><br/>\n",

Let me tell you something, the heat jumped on this thing and turned it up a notch. I could sense it still there but sticking a little close to the skin but not anymore, it began to rise into my nose. Actually I didn't come off until I bathed that night. <br/><br/>\n",
       "So this thing is versatile, it can be worn to work, it can be worn on a date, it can be worn to a club and it will fit perfectly in each. I actually believe the club will make it heat up a little more much like taking my kids to the park in 85 degree weather. It is a nice first impression scent but not overbearing (say like 1 Million though I would wear that one to just to see the response). I think any age can pull this off it is young enough for a high schooler though he would stick out and it is defintely mature and sexy enough for a 50 year old to pull off.<br/><br/>\n",

After discussing this fragrance with my younger sister (who is 24 years old, myself 27 years old), who tried this perfume often on her husband, I just got the conclusion (which to say to truth I was also aware after trying this woman-magnet art of perfumes), that exactly this combination (masculine + feminine scents in a men’s perfume) makes this perfume one of the most sexy (if not the sexiest) perfume on men on a romantic winter night. Perfect! Even my sister was not able to tell me why women find this so sexy on a men, why they love if a perfume for men includes ’feminine/unisex’ parts, but that’s a kind of psychology...or just fashion of the unisex perfumes? If the fashion of the unisex perfumes on a men and the taste/psychology of women are in relation to each other, I don’t know...<br/>\n",

So describe this as a sweeter version of the original L'Homme, but to me this is not sweet at all. To my nose this comes off as sour and flat. To me this smells like a mixture of Gucci Pour Homme 2 (tea note) and Narcisco Rodrigues For Him (the wet asphalt)...mic these two fragrances together and you get La Nuit de L' Homme. The projection and longevity on this is very weak and is on its way to disappearing four hours into the wearing. For me its a pass.<br/><br/>\n",

       "I can now give my official review on Laurent's latest edition. It is magnetic! As they say, nothing beats the original but the two go head to head. Whereas they both hold their own categories. Nuit is like L'Homme's exotic cousin. This version took an oriental turn, and that has a lot to do with the tonka bean addition. Be mindful that Nuit is potent, too little or too much can take away from this attractive fragrance. I gave one of my arms a full squeeze of the sprayer cap and I'm convinced that I don't need anymore. So, for those of you who label this scent \"cloying\" or \"overbearing,\" keep in mind that one should be generous when applying. <br/><br/>\n",
